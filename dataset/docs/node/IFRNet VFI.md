- `IFRNet VFI`: The IFRNet VFI node is designed for video frame interpolation, leveraging deep learning models to predict and generate intermediate frames between existing frames in a video sequence. This process enhances video smoothness and can be used to increase the frame rate of videos.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: Specifies the checkpoint name for the model to use, affecting the interpolation quality and style based on the trained data. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clear_cache_after_n_frames`: Determines after how many frames the cache should be cleared to prevent memory overflow, impacting performance and memory usage. Type should be `INT`.
        - `multiplier`: Defines the number of intermediate frames to be generated between each pair of original frames, directly affecting the output video's frame rate. Type should be `INT`.
        - `scale_factor`: The scale factor for resizing frames during the interpolation process, influencing the resolution of the output frames. Type should be `COMBO[FLOAT]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `frames`: The input video frames to be interpolated, serving as the basis for generating intermediate frames. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `optional_interpolation_states`: Optional states to control the interpolation process, allowing for customization of frame skipping and other behaviors. Type should be `INTERPOLATION_STATES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output interpolated frames, enhancing the smoothness and frame rate of the input video sequence. Type should be `IMAGE`.
