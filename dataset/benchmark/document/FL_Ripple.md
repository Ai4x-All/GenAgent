- `FL_Ripple`: The FL_Ripple node applies a ripple effect to a collection of images, transforming each image by simulating a ripple pattern. This effect is achieved through mathematical manipulation of the image pixels, based on specified parameters such as amplitude, frequency, and phase, to create visually dynamic results.
    - Inputs:
        - `images` (Required): A collection of images to which the ripple effect will be applied. This parameter is essential for determining the input images that will undergo the transformation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `amplitude` (Optional): Defines the height of the ripple waves. A higher amplitude results in more pronounced ripples. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `frequency` (Optional): Determines the number of ripples in the image. Higher frequencies result in more ripples within a given space. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `phase` (Optional): Adjusts the starting point of the ripple effect, allowing for phase shifts in the wave pattern. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is an image with the ripple effect applied, represented as a tensor. Type should be `IMAGE`.
