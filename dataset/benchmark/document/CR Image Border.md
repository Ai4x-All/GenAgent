- `CR Image Border`: This node is designed to add customizable borders around images. It allows for the adjustment of border thickness on all sides and the specification of border color, including the option to use a hex color code. Additionally, it supports the creation of feathered borders, providing a soft, blurred edge effect around the image.

        - `bottom_thickness` (Required): Specifies the thickness of the border at the bottom edge of the image. This parameter enables the user to customize the border's appearance by adjusting its size. Type should be `INT`.
        - `left_thickness` (Required): Specifies the thickness of the border at the left edge of the image. This parameter allows for the customization of the border's appearance by adjusting its size. Type should be `INT`.
        - `right_thickness` (Required): Specifies the thickness of the border at the right edge of the image. This parameter enables the user to customize the border's appearance by adjusting its size. Type should be `INT`.
