- `ttN pipeIN`: The ttN pipeIN node serves as a foundational element in the ttN/legacy category, designed to initialize and configure pipelines for generative tasks. It encapsulates the process of setting up various components such as models, conditioning elements, and latent spaces, facilitating the creation of a structured pipeline ready for further processing or generation.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: Sets the random seed for reproducibility of the generative process. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: Specifies the generative model to be used in the pipeline, serving as the core component around which other elements are configured. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `pos`: Defines positive conditioning information to guide the generative model towards desired outputs. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `neg`: Specifies negative conditioning information, used to steer the generative model away from undesired outputs. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent`: Represents the latent space configuration, providing a basis for the generative process. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `vae`: Specifies the VAE (Variational Autoencoder) component, used for encoding and decoding in the generative process. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `clip`: Defines the CLIP model used for semantic understanding and alignment between text and images. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `image`: Optional parameter for specifying an initial image to be used in the pipeline. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: Outputs a configured pipeline object, encapsulating the specified models, conditioning, and configurations for further processing. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
