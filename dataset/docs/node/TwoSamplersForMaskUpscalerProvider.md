- `TwoSamplersForMaskUpscalerProvider`: This node provides a mechanism to upscale images using two distinct samplers, each responsible for different regions of the image, based on a mask. It enables the selective application of upscaling techniques to enhance image quality or add details in a controlled manner.
    - Parameters:
        - `scale_method`: Specifies the method used for scaling during the upscaling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `full_sample_schedule`: Defines the sampling schedule for the full image upscaling. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `use_tiled_vae`: Indicates whether a tiled VAE approach is used for upscaling. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `tile_size`: Specifies the size of the tiles when using a tiled VAE approach. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `base_sampler`: The primary sampler used for upscaling the image, applied to the regions not covered by the mask. Type should be `KSAMPLER`.
        - `mask_sampler`: A specialized sampler used for upscaling the regions of the image specified by the mask. Type should be `KSAMPLER`.
        - `mask`: A binary mask indicating the regions of the image to be specifically upscaled by the mask_sampler. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `vae`: The variational autoencoder used in the upscaling process. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `full_sampler_opt`: Options for the full sampler used in the upscaling process. Type should be `KSAMPLER`.
        - `upscale_model_opt`: Options for the upscale model used in the upscaling process. Type should be `UPSCALE_MODEL`.
        - `pk_hook_base_opt`: Options for the base hook in the upscaling process. Type should be `PK_HOOK`.
        - `pk_hook_mask_opt`: Options for the mask hook in the upscaling process. Type should be `PK_HOOK`.
        - `pk_hook_full_opt`: Options for the full hook in the upscaling process. Type should be `PK_HOOK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `upscaler`: The upscaled latent image after applying both the base and mask samplers. Type should be `UPSCALER`.
