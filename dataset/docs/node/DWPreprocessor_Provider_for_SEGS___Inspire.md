- `DWPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS __Inspire`: The DWPreprocessor Provider for SEGS is designed to preprocess images for segmentation tasks by detecting various elements such as hands, body, and face, and adjusting image resolution. It utilizes bounding box detectors and pose estimators to enhance the input data for better segmentation results.
    - Parameters:
        - `detect_hand`: Enables or disables hand detection in the preprocessing step, affecting the focus and accuracy of the segmentation. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `detect_body`: Enables or disables body detection, influencing the segmentation process by identifying body outlines. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `detect_face`: Activates or deactivates face detection, impacting the segmentation by highlighting facial features. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `resolution_upscale_by`: Adjusts the resolution of the input image by a specified upscale factor, enhancing the detail level for segmentation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `bbox_detector`: Specifies the bounding box detector model to use, affecting the precision of element detection. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `pose_estimator`: Determines the pose estimator model to employ, enhancing the segmentation with accurate pose information. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `segs_preprocessor`: Provides a preprocessed input tailored for segmentation tasks, incorporating detected elements and resolution adjustments. Type should be `SEGS_PREPROCESSOR`.
