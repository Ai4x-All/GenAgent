- `Masks Combine Regions`: The node is designed to merge or combine multiple mask regions into a single cohesive mask. This process is essential for applications requiring unified mask representations from segmented or individually processed mask regions.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `mask_a`: The 'mask_a' parameter represents one of the individual mask regions to be combined. It is a crucial part of the input set for generating a unified mask. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask_b`: The 'mask_b' parameter is another individual mask region that contributes to the creation of a unified mask. It is essential for the combination process. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask_c`: The 'mask_c' parameter is an optional mask region that can be included in the combination process to contribute to the unified mask. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask_d`: The 'mask_d' parameter is an optional mask region that can be included in the combination process to contribute to the unified mask. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask_e`: The 'mask_e' parameter is an optional mask region that can be included in the combination process to contribute to the unified mask. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask_f`: The 'mask_f' parameter is an optional mask region that can be included in the combination process to contribute to the unified mask. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The 'mask' output represents the unified mask generated by combining the input mask regions. It is significant for downstream tasks that require a single, comprehensive mask representation. Type should be `MASK`.
