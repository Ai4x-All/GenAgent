- `CM_Vec2ToScalarBinaryOperation`: This node performs a binary operation between two 2-dimensional vectors, resulting in a scalar value. It abstracts mathematical operations that take two vectors as input and produce a single scalar output, such as dot product or distance calculation.
    - Parameters:
        - `op`: Specifies the binary operation to be performed on the vectors. It affects the nature of the scalar result obtained from the operation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `a`: The first 2-dimensional vector involved in the binary operation. Type should be `VEC2`.
        - `b`: The second 2-dimensional vector involved in the binary operation. Type should be `VEC2`.
    - Outputs:
        - `float`: The scalar result of the binary operation performed on the two vectors. Type should be `FLOAT`.
