- `SEGSLabelFilterDetailerHookProvider`: The SEGSLabelFilterDetailerHookProvider node is designed to create and configure a detailer hook that filters segments based on specified labels. It allows for the customization of segment filtering through user-defined labels, enabling the targeting of specific segment types for processing or exclusion.
    - Parameters:
        - `preset`: The 'preset' parameter allows for the selection of a predefined set of labels or the inclusion of all detection labels. This flexibility aids in quickly configuring the filter based on common use cases or custom requirements. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `labels`: The 'labels' parameter specifies the types of segments to be allowed, separated by commas. It directly influences the filtering outcome by defining which segment labels are considered valid for inclusion. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `segs`: The 'segs' parameter represents the segments to be filtered. It is crucial for determining which segments are subject to the filtering process. Type should be `SEGS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `detailer_hook`: This output represents the configured detailer hook, ready to be applied for segment filtering based on the specified labels. Type should be `DETAILER_HOOK`.
