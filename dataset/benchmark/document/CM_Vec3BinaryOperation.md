- `CM_Vec3BinaryOperation`: Performs binary operations on two 3-dimensional vectors, resulting in a new 3-dimensional vector. This node abstracts complex vector arithmetic into simple, high-level operations.
    - Inputs:
        - `op` (Required): Specifies the binary operation to perform on the vectors, such as addition or subtraction, influencing the result of the operation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `a` (Required): The first 3-dimensional vector operand in the binary operation. Type should be `VEC3`.
        - `b` (Required): The second 3-dimensional vector operand in the binary operation. Type should be `VEC3`.
    - Outputs:
        - `vec3`: The resulting 3-dimensional vector after performing the specified binary operation on the input vectors. Type should be `VEC3`.
