- `CM_Vec3ScalarOperation`: Performs scalar operations on 3-dimensional vectors, allowing for mathematical manipulations such as scaling and division by a scalar value.
    - Parameters:
        - `op`: Specifies the scalar operation to be performed on the vector, such as multiplication or division, influencing the resulting vector's magnitude or direction. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `b`: The scalar value to be used in the operation, affecting the vector's magnitude or direction based on the specified operation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `a`: The 3-dimensional vector to be operated on, serving as the primary operand for the scalar operation. Type should be `VEC3`.
    - Outputs:
        - `vec3`: The resulting 3-dimensional vector after applying the specified scalar operation, reflecting changes in magnitude or direction. Type should be `VEC3`.
