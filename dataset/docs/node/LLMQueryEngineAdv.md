- `LLMQueryEngineAdv`: The LLMQueryEngineAdv node is designed to enhance querying capabilities by leveraging language models and embedding models to process and understand complex queries. It integrates advanced settings and post-processing to refine search results based on similarity and relevance.
    - Parameters:
        - `query`: The user's input query, which is processed to extract information or answer questions based on the data indexed. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `top_k`: Specifies the number of top results to retrieve, allowing for control over the breadth of the search results. Type should be `INT`.
        - `similarity_cutoff`: A threshold for filtering results based on their similarity score, ensuring relevance of the returned information. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `llm_model`: Represents the language and embedding models used for query processing. It's crucial for understanding and generating responses to the queries. Type should be `LLM_MODEL`.
        - `llm_index`: The index used for retrieving information, essential for navigating through the data and extracting relevant responses. Type should be `LLM_INDEX`.
        - `llm_message`: A list of messages that can be used to provide additional context or information for the query processing. Type should be `LIST`.
    - Outputs:
        - `results`: The processed query results, returned in a structured format. Type should be `STRING`.
