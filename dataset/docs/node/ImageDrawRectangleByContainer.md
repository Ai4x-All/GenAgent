- `ImageDrawRectangleByContainer`: This node is designed to draw rectangles within a specified container, allowing for precise control over the rectangle's dimensions and styling. It enables the creation of graphical elements within images by specifying start and end points, as well as color and style attributes.
    - Parameters:
        - `start_x`: The starting x-coordinate for the rectangle, marking the beginning of the rectangle's horizontal boundary. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_y`: The starting y-coordinate for the rectangle, marking the beginning of the rectangle's vertical boundary. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_x`: The ending x-coordinate for the rectangle, defining the end of the rectangle's horizontal boundary. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_y`: The ending y-coordinate for the rectangle, defining the end of the rectangle's vertical boundary. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `outline_size`: Specifies the thickness of the rectangle's outline, allowing for customization of the rectangle's border. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_red`: The red component of the outline's color, contributing to the overall color of the rectangle's border. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_green`: The green component of the outline's color, contributing to the overall color of the rectangle's border. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_blue`: The blue component of the outline's color, contributing to the overall color of the rectangle's border. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_alpha`: The alpha (transparency) component of the outline's color, allowing for transparency effects in the rectangle's border. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `fill_red`: The red component of the rectangle's fill color, determining the primary color inside the rectangle. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_green`: The green component of the rectangle's fill color, determining the primary color inside the rectangle. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_blue`: The blue component of the rectangle's fill color, determining the primary color inside the rectangle. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_alpha`: The alpha (transparency) component of the rectangle's fill color, allowing for transparency effects inside the rectangle. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `SSAA`: Specifies the Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing factor to enhance the image quality by reducing the aliasing effects. Type should be `INT`.
        - `method`: Defines the method used for drawing operations, affecting the rendering quality and performance. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `container`: The container within which the rectangle will be drawn, defining the boundary and context for the drawing operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting image with the rectangle drawn within the specified container, reflecting all specified styling and dimensions. Type should be `IMAGE`.
