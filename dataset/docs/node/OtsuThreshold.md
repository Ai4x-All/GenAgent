- `OtsuThreshold`: The OtsuThreshold node applies Otsu's thresholding method to an image to separate the foreground from the background. It optionally preprocesses the image with Gaussian blur to reduce noise and improve the thresholding result.
    - Parameters:
        - `threshold_type`: Specifies the type of thresholding to apply, which influences how the foreground and background are distinguished. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `gaussian_blur_x`: The kernel width for the Gaussian blur. A higher value means more blurring, which can help in reducing noise before thresholding. Type should be `INT`.
        - `gaussian_blur_y`: The kernel height for the Gaussian blur. Works in conjunction with gaussian_blur_x to define the blur extent. Type should be `INT`.
        - `gaussian_border_type`: Determines how the border of the image is handled during the Gaussian blur process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be thresholded. It is the primary data on which Otsu's method will be applied. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output image after applying Otsu's thresholding, with the foreground and background separated. Type should be `IMAGE`.
