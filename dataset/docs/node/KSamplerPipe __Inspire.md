- `KSamplerPipe __Inspire`: The KSamplerPipe node is designed to facilitate the generation of inspirational content through a specialized sampling process. It integrates advanced sampling techniques to produce creative and novel outputs, leveraging the Inspire Pack's capabilities to enhance the creative process.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: Specifies the seed for the sampling process, ensuring reproducibility and control over the generation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Determines the number of steps in the sampling process, affecting the depth and detail of the generation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Configures the conditioning factor, influencing the creativity and coherence of the generated content. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Selects the specific sampler to use, tailoring the sampling process to achieve desired effects. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Chooses the scheduler for controlling the sampling process, optimizing the generation flow. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: Adjusts the level of denoising applied to the output, balancing between clarity and creative distortion. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `noise_mode`: Specifies the mode of noise application, affecting the texture and overall appearance of the generated content. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `batch_seed_mode`: Defines the seed mode for batch processing, ensuring consistency and variability across generated outputs. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `variation_seed`: Optional seed for introducing variations, enhancing the diversity of the generated content. Type should be `INT`.
        - `variation_strength`: Determines the strength of variations introduced, allowing for subtle to significant changes in the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `basic_pipe`: Represents the foundational components required for the sampling process, including models and configurations essential for generating the output. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
        - `latent_image`: Provides an initial latent image to be used as a starting point for the sampling process, enabling more targeted and specific content generation. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The latent representation of the generated content, encapsulating the creative essence and potential for further processing. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `vae`: The variational autoencoder used in the process, instrumental in transforming and refining the generated content. Type should be `VAE`.
