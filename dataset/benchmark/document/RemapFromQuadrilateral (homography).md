- `RemapFromQuadrilateral (homography)`: The RemapFromQuadrilateral node is designed for transforming images based on a source mask that defines a quadrilateral region. It primarily utilizes a homography transformation to map the specified quadrilateral region from the source image to a target rectangular shape, adjusting the image accordingly. This node is particularly useful for correcting or altering the perspective of an image region defined by four points.
    - Inputs:
        - `src_mask_with_i_points` (Required): Specifies the source mask with four points defining the quadrilateral region to be transformed. This mask is crucial for determining the area of the image that will undergo the homography transformation. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `width` (Required): Defines the width of the target image after the transformation. This parameter directly influences the dimensions of the output image, ensuring that the transformed quadrilateral fits within these specified bounds. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height` (Required): Specifies the height of the target image post-transformation. Similar to the width parameter, it determines the dimensions of the output image, ensuring the transformed area is appropriately scaled. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `remap`: The primary output of this node is the transformed image or 'remap', which results from applying the homography transformation to the specified quadrilateral region. This output is crucial for understanding the effect of the transformation on the original image. Type should be `REMAP`.
