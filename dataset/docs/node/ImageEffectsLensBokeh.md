- `ImageEffectsLensBokeh`: This node applies a bokeh effect to images, simulating the aesthetic quality of the blur produced in the out-of-focus parts of an image. It leverages parameters related to lens characteristics and blur intensity to create visually appealing effects that mimic the behavior of real camera lenses.
    - Parameters:
        - `blades_shape`: Defines the shape of the lens through which the bokeh effect is simulated, affecting the overall appearance of the blur. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blades_radius`: Specifies the radius of the lens blades, influencing the size and shape of the bokeh blur. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blades_rotation`: Determines the rotation angle of the lens blades, affecting the orientation of the bokeh blur. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `blur_size`: Sets the size of the blur effect, enabling fine-tuning of how pronounced the bokeh effect appears on the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blur_type`: Specifies the type of blur to be applied, offering different methods for achieving the bokeh effect. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `method`: Determines the method used to apply the lens blur, affecting the final appearance of the bokeh effect. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The input images to which the bokeh effect will be applied. This parameter is crucial for defining the base content that will undergo the transformation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The transformed image with the applied bokeh effect, showcasing the visual enhancement achieved through the simulation of lens characteristics and blur adjustments. Type should be `IMAGE`.
