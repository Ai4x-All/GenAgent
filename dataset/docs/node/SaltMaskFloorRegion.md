- `SaltMaskFloorRegion`: The SaltMaskFloorRegion node is designed to identify and isolate floor regions within given masks. It processes each mask to extract the floor area, converting it into a tensor that represents the floor region.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `masks`: The input masks for which floor regions need to be identified. These masks are processed to extract floor areas, significantly impacting the node's output. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `MASKS`: The output tensor representing the isolated floor regions within the input masks. Type should be `MASK`.
