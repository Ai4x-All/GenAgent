- `AV_ControlNetEfficientLoader`: This node specializes in efficiently loading ControlNet configurations, optimizing the process for enhanced performance and resource utilization. It extends the capabilities of a standard ControlNet loader by incorporating advanced techniques to streamline the loading operation, making it suitable for scenarios requiring high efficiency.
    - Parameters:
        - `control_net_name`: Specifies the name of the ControlNet configuration to be loaded. This parameter is crucial for identifying which configuration file to access and load, directly influencing the node's operation by determining the specific ControlNet to be utilized. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `strength`: Determines the intensity of the ControlNet's application on the image, allowing for fine-tuned control over the effect's strength. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `preprocessor`: Specifies the preprocessor to be used on the image before applying the ControlNet, affecting the input image's condition and potentially its compatibility with the ControlNet. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `control_net_override`: Allows for the dynamic overriding of the specified ControlNet configuration. This flexibility is key for scenarios where conditional or runtime decisions may dictate the use of an alternative configuration, thereby affecting the outcome of the loading process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `resolution`: The resolution at which the image should be processed, impacting the quality and detail of the ControlNet's application. Type should be `INT`.
        - `enabled`: A flag to enable or disable the ControlNet loading and application process, providing a mechanism to conditionally bypass this node's operation. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `conditioning`: The conditioning data to be applied in conjunction with the ControlNet, influencing the final output by adjusting the model's behavior based on specified conditions. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `image`: The image input that the ControlNet will process, serving as a basis for the application of the ControlNet's effects or transformations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `timestep_keyframe`: Defines a specific timestep or keyframe within the ControlNet configuration to be loaded. This parameter enables precise control over the loading process, allowing for targeted access to specific portions of the ControlNet, which can be critical for temporal or sequential applications. Type should be `TIMESTEP_KEYFRAME`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: Returns the conditioning data after the application of the ControlNet, reflecting any modifications or enhancements made during the process. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
