- `PromptSchedule`: The PromptSchedule node is designed to process and sequence user-defined prompts, incorporating expressions and scheduling mechanisms to generate a series of conditionings. It evaluates the user's input, sequences the prompts based on specified conditions, and returns a batch of conditionings with the applied schedule, facilitating dynamic and temporal control over the generation process.
    - Parameters:
        - `text`: This input captures the user-defined prompt text, serving as the primary content for processing and conditioning. It is essential for determining the direction and tone of the generated output. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `max_frames`: Specifies the maximum number of frames for the animation or sequence, setting an upper limit on the length and complexity of the generated content. Type should be `INT`.
        - `current_frame`: Indicates the current frame in the sequence, used to determine the specific conditioning and adjustments needed at this point in the generation process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `print_output`: A boolean flag that, when set to true, enables the printing of the node's output for debugging or monitoring purposes. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `pre_text`: Optional text to prepend to the main prompt, allowing for additional context or instructions to be included in the generation process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `app_text`: Optional text to append to the main prompt, providing a way to add further details or directives to the end of the prompt. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `pw_a`: A weight parameter for adjusting the influence of the pre_text in the generation process, offering fine-tuned control over the conditioning. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_b`: A weight parameter for adjusting the influence of the app_text in the generation process, allowing for customized emphasis on appended text. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_c`: An additional weight parameter, providing further customization options for the conditioning process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_d`: Another weight parameter, enabling precise adjustments to the generation's conditioning based on user-defined criteria. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip`: The clip parameter specifies the clip model to be used for conditioning the input text, playing a crucial role in the generation process by influencing the quality and relevance of the output. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `POS`: This output represents the positively conditioned aspect of the content, reflecting the emphasis and adjustments made based on the input prompts and settings. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `NEG`: This output captures the negatively conditioned aspect, providing a counterbalance to the positive elements and ensuring a nuanced and balanced final output. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
