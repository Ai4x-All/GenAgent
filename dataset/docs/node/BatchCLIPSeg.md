- `BatchCLIPSeg`: This node segments an image or a batch of images using the CLIPSeg model, leveraging natural language descriptions to guide the segmentation process. It is designed to work with images and textual descriptions to produce segmented masks, optionally applying thresholding and mask manipulation techniques.
    - Parameters:
        - `text`: A textual description guiding the segmentation process. This description is used to align the segmentation with the user's intent. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `threshold`: A value to determine the sensitivity of the segmentation. Adjusting this threshold affects the segmentation's granularity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `binary_mask`: Determines whether the output mask should be binary. This affects the mask's representation, simplifying it to binary form if true. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `combine_mask`: Controls whether to combine masks for multiple objects into a single mask. This affects the output by potentially merging multiple segmented areas. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `use_cuda`: Indicates whether to use CUDA for processing. This can significantly speed up the segmentation process on compatible hardware. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The images to be segmented. This input is crucial as it provides the visual data for the segmentation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `Mask`: The segmented mask(s) produced by the node. These masks correspond to the areas of interest as defined by the input images and textual descriptions. Type should be `MASK`.
