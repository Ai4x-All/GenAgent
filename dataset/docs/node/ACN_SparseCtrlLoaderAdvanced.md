- `ACN_SparseCtrlLoaderAdvanced`: The node is designed to load a Sparse ControlNet model, which is a specialized form of control network that utilizes sparse methods for enhanced control and manipulation of generative models. It supports motion-based adjustments and allows for the specification of sparse methods and optional timestep keyframes for fine-tuned control.
    - Parameters:
        - `sparsectrl_name`: Specifies the name of the Sparse ControlNet to be loaded, serving as a key identifier for retrieving the appropriate model files. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `use_motion`: A boolean flag that determines whether motion-based adjustments should be applied to the control network, enhancing dynamic control. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `motion_strength`: Defines the strength of the motion effect applied, allowing for the modulation of motion intensity in the control network. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `motion_scale`: Sets the scale of motion effects, providing a means to adjust the overall impact of motion on the control network. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `sparse_method`: Specifies the sparse method to be used, offering a choice of techniques for sparse control. Type should be `SPARSE_METHOD`.
        - `tk_optional`: An optional parameter that allows for the inclusion of timestep keyframes, enabling precise control over specific moments or phases. Type should be `TIMESTEP_KEYFRAME`.
    - Outputs:
        - `control_net`: Returns the loaded Sparse ControlNet model, ready for integration and use in generative tasks. Type should be `CONTROL_NET`.
