- `Remap`: The Remap node is designed to transform an image by applying a specific remapping operation. It serves as a foundational class for more specialized remapping operations, such as adjusting the perspective or distorting the image in various ways to achieve desired visual effects.
    - Parameters:
        - `interpolation`: Defines the interpolation method used during the remapping process, affecting the quality and appearance of the output image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `output_with_alpha`: Indicates whether the output image should include an alpha channel, allowing for transparency effects. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `remap`: Specifies the remapping operation to be applied, including the function and arguments necessary for the transformation. It is crucial for defining how the image will be altered. Type should be `REMAP`.
        - `src`: The source image to be transformed. It is the primary input on which the remapping operation is applied. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `src_mask`: An optional mask that can be applied to the source image, allowing for selective remapping based on the mask's coverage. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The transformed image resulting from the applied remapping operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: The mask generated during the remapping process, corresponding to the transformed areas of the source image. Type should be `MASK`.
