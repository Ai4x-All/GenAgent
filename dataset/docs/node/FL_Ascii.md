- `FL_Ascii`: The FL_Ascii node transforms images into ASCII art by resizing the input image based on specified spacing and then mapping pixel brightness values to characters. This artistic effect leverages a chosen font and character set to recreate the original image with a unique, text-based aesthetic.
    - Parameters:
        - `spacing`: Determines the spacing between characters in the ASCII art, affecting the resolution and detail of the output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `font_size`: Specifies the size of the font used in generating ASCII art, influencing the clarity and readability of the text. Type should be `INT`.
        - `font_name`: The name of the font used to render characters in the ASCII art, impacting the style and appearance of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `characters`: A string of characters used as the palette for creating the ASCII art, where each character's placement is based on pixel brightness. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be transformed into ASCII art. It serves as the canvas for the ASCII conversion process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting ASCII art as an image, showcasing the original image reinterpreted with characters. Type should be `IMAGE`.
