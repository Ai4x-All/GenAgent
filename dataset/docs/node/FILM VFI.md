- `FILM VFI`: The FILM_VFI node specializes in frame interpolation, leveraging advanced techniques to synthesize intermediate frames between two given images. It aims to enhance video fluidity and realism by accurately predicting and generating frames that could logically exist in the temporal space between the original frames.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: Specifies the checkpoint name for the model to use, which is crucial for determining the specific interpolation technique and parameters to apply. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clear_cache_after_n_frames`: Controls how often the system's cache is cleared during processing, affecting memory management and potentially influencing performance. Type should be `INT`.
        - `multiplier`: Determines the number of frames to be interpolated between each pair of original frames, directly impacting the smoothness of the output video. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `frames`: Represents the sequence of images to be interpolated. The node uses these frames as a basis for generating new frames that fit seamlessly into the existing sequence. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `optional_interpolation_states`: Allows for the specification of custom interpolation states, offering flexibility in handling frame skipping or other advanced interpolation scenarios. Type should be `INTERPOLATION_STATES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: Produces an interpolated image sequence, enhancing the fluidity and realism of the original video by filling in missing frames. Type should be `IMAGE`.
