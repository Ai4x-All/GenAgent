- `CreateShapeMaskOnPath`: This node is designed to generate shape-based masks along a specified path, enabling the creation of dynamic and animated masking effects. It leverages shape parameters and path coordinates to craft masks that can evolve over time, providing a versatile tool for visual effects and image manipulation.
    - Parameters:
        - `shape`: Specifies the geometric shape of the mask to be created. This choice influences the mask's appearance and can be a circle, square, or triangle, offering a variety of visual styles for the mask. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `coordinates`: Defines the center locations for the mask creation along a path. These coordinates dictate where the mask will be positioned, allowing for precise control over the mask's placement in the frame. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `grow`: Determines the amount by which the shape grows on each frame, enabling the creation of animated masks that change size over time. Type should be `INT`.
        - `frame_width`: Sets the width of the frame within which the mask is created, defining the spatial boundaries for mask generation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `frame_height`: Sets the height of the frame within which the mask is created, defining the spatial boundaries for mask generation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `shape_width`: Specifies the initial width of the shape used to create the mask, affecting the mask's size and coverage area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `shape_height`: Specifies the initial height of the shape used to create the mask, affecting the mask's size and coverage area. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The primary output mask created based on the specified shape and path coordinates. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask_inverted`: An inverted version of the primary mask, offering an alternative masking option where the shape's area is transparent and the surrounding area is opaque. Type should be `MASK`.
