- `XYAny`: The XYAny node is designed to generate combinations of X and Y values, optionally incorporating a third dimension, Z, to extend these combinations. It facilitates the creation and labeling of these combinations, providing fallback labels and the ability to specify custom labels. This node is particularly useful for data manipulation and preparation tasks where the relationships or interactions between different sets of data points need to be explored or visualized.
    - Inputs:
        - `X` (Required): The primary set of values to be combined. Acts as one axis in the generation of value pairs. Type should be `*`.
        - `Y` (Required): The secondary set of values to be combined with the X values. Acts as the other axis in the generation of value pairs. Type should be `*`.
        - `X_Label_Fallback` (Required): Fallback labels for the X values, used when specific labels are not provided. Ensures that each X value has an associated label. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `Y_Label_Fallback` (Required): Fallback labels for the Y values, used when specific labels are not provided. Ensures that each Y value has an associated label. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `Z_Label_Fallback` (Required): Fallback labels for the Z values, used when specific labels are not provided. This allows for a third dimension of data to be labeled. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `Z` (Optional): An optional third set of values to be combined with the X and Y values, adding a third dimension to the combinations. Type should be `*`.
        - `X_Labels` (Optional): Custom labels for the X values, overriding the fallback labels if provided. Type should be `*`.
        - `Y_Labels` (Optional): Custom labels for the Y values, overriding the fallback labels if provided. Type should be `*`.
        - `Z_Labels` (Optional): Custom labels for the Z values, overriding the fallback labels if provided. Type should be `*`.
    - Outputs:
        - `X Values`: The combined X values resulting from the combinations generated by the node. Type should be `*`.
        - `X Labels`: The labels associated with the combined X values. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `Y Values`: The combined Y values resulting from the combinations generated by the node. Type should be `*`.
        - `Y Labels`: The labels associated with the combined Y values. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `Z Values`: The combined Z values resulting from the combinations generated by the node, if Z values were provided. Type should be `*`.
        - `Z Labels`: The labels associated with the combined Z values, if Z values were provided. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `Total Images`: The total number of combinations generated by the node. Type should be `INT`.
        - `Split Every`: The interval at which the combinations are split, based on the length of the Y values. Type should be `INT`.
