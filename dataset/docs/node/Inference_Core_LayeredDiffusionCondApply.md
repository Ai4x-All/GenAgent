- `Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionCondApply`: This node specializes in applying conditional layered diffusion processes to input data, leveraging specific configurations and weights to modulate the diffusion effect. It integrates conditional inputs to guide the diffusion process, enhancing the generation or transformation of data with nuanced control.
    - Parameters:
        - `config`: Configuration string specifying the diffusion model and settings, crucial for determining the behavior of the diffusion process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `weight`: A weight factor that influences the strength and characteristics of the diffusion effect applied to the model. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model to which the layered diffusion process will be applied, serving as the foundation for the diffusion modifications. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `cond`: The conditional inputs for the foreground, guiding the diffusion process to achieve specific visual effects or characteristics. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `uncond`: The unconditional inputs for the background, providing a baseline for the diffusion process and influencing the overall output. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent`: Latent representations used in the diffusion process, contributing to the generation or transformation of the output. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: Outputs a modified model that has undergone the conditional layered diffusion process, reflecting the applied conditions and adjustments. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `conditioning`: The conditioning information used during the diffusion process, indicating how the conditional inputs have influenced the output. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
