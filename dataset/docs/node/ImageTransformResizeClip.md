- `ImageTransformResizeClip`: This node is designed to resize images within specified maximum and minimum dimensions, using various interpolation methods to maintain image quality. It dynamically calculates the scale to ensure the resized image adheres to the given constraints, offering a flexible approach to image resizing.
    - Parameters:
        - `max_width`: The maximum width constraint for the resizing operation. It sets an upper limit on the width of the resized images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `max_height`: The maximum height constraint for the resizing operation. It sets an upper limit on the height of the resized images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `min_width`: The minimum width constraint for the resizing operation. It ensures that the resized images do not fall below this width. Type should be `INT`.
        - `min_height`: The minimum height constraint for the resizing operation. It ensures that the resized images do not fall below this height. Type should be `INT`.
        - `method`: The interpolation method used for resizing. This affects the quality and the algorithm of the resizing process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The collection of images to be resized. This parameter is crucial as it directly influences the output by determining which images undergo the resizing process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resized images, adjusted within the specified maximum and minimum dimensions. Type should be `IMAGE`.
