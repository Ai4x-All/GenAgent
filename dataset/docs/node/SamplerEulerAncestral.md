- `SamplerEulerAncestral`: This node provides a mechanism to generate samples using the Euler Ancestral sampling method, tailored for specific noise and step size adjustments.
    - Parameters:
        - `eta`: Specifies the step size for the Euler method, influencing the granularity of the sampling process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `s_noise`: Determines the scale of noise to be added at each step, affecting the variability of the samples. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `sampler`: Outputs a sampler configured for Euler Ancestral sampling, ready for generating samples. Type should be `SAMPLER`.
