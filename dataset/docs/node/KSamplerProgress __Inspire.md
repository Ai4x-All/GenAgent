- `KSamplerProgress __Inspire`: The KSamplerProgressInspire node is designed to iteratively sample and refine latent images over a series of steps, allowing for progressive visualization of the sampling process. It leverages advanced sampling techniques to enhance the quality and diversity of generated images, catering to applications that require detailed image progression analysis.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: Defines the seed for noise generation, ensuring reproducibility and consistency in the sampling outcomes. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Determines the number of steps in the sampling process, directly influencing the refinement and progression of the latent image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Configuration settings for the sampling process, tailoring the behavior and parameters of the sampler. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Identifies the specific sampler to use, affecting the sampling strategy and resultant image characteristics. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Specifies the scheduler for controlling the sampling process, impacting the progression and quality of image generation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: Specifies the denoising factor applied during the sampling process, affecting the clarity and detail of the generated images. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `noise_mode`: The mode of noise application during sampling, influencing the texture and detail of the generated images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `interval`: The interval at which to capture and return latent images, facilitating progressive visualization. Type should be `INT`.
        - `omit_start_latent`: Indicates whether to exclude the starting latent image from the results, allowing for flexibility in the progression output. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: Specifies the model used for sampling, central to determining the characteristics and quality of the generated images. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `positive`: Positive prompts guiding the sampling towards desired image attributes, enhancing relevance and specificity. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Negative prompts used to steer away the sampling from undesired image attributes, refining the output quality. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent_image`: The initial latent image to be refined through the sampling process, serving as the starting point for progression. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The final latent image after the completion of the sampling process, representing the culmination of the progressive refinement. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `progress_latent`: A collection of latent images captured at specified intervals during the sampling process, illustrating the progression of image refinement. Type should be `LATENT`.
