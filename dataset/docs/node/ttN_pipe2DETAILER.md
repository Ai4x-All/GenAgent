- `ttN pipe2DETAILER`: The ttN pipe2DETAILER node is designed to enhance and detail a given pipeline with additional features and processing steps, incorporating bounding box detection, optional segmentation, and other detailing functionalities to refine the output.
    - Parameters:
        - `wildcard`: A flexible input for additional specifications or configurations, allowing for custom adjustments to the detailing process. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Represents the pipeline to be enhanced and detailed, serving as the foundational structure for further processing. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `bbox_detector`: Specifies the bounding box detector to be used for identifying regions of interest within the pipeline's output. Type should be `BBOX_DETECTOR`.
        - `sam_model_opt`: An optional model for semantic segmentation, providing additional detail through segmentation masks. Type should be `SAM_MODEL`.
        - `segm_detector_opt`: An optional segmentation detector to further refine the output with segmentation details. Type should be `SEGM_DETECTOR`.
        - `detailer_hook`: A hook for custom detailing functions, enabling further customization of the detailing process. Type should be `DETAILER_HOOK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `detailer_pipe`: The enhanced and detailed version of the input pipeline, incorporating additional features and processing steps. Type should be `DETAILER_PIPE`.
        - `pipe`: The original pipeline input, returned for reference or further processing. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
