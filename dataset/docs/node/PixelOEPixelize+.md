- `PixelOEPixelize+`: The PixelOEPixelize+ node is designed to transform images into pixelized versions of themselves, applying a series of image processing techniques to achieve a stylized, pixel-art effect. This node leverages parameters such as downscale mode, target size, and patch size to control the pixelization process, while also offering options for thickness, color matching, and upscale to fine-tune the visual output.
    - Parameters:
        - `downscale_mode`: Specifies the method used for downscaling the image as part of the pixelization process, affecting the visual style of the pixelized output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `target_size`: Determines the overall dimensions to which the image will be resized during the pixelization process, impacting the scale of the pixel effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `patch_size`: Controls the size of the individual 'pixels' or patches in the pixelized image, allowing for customization of the pixel art effect's granularity. Type should be `INT`.
        - `thickness`: Adjusts the thickness of the lines or borders between pixels in the pixelized image, contributing to the stylized appearance. Type should be `INT`.
        - `color_matching`: Influences how colors are matched and blended in the pixelized output, affecting the image's color accuracy and aesthetic. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `upscale`: Determines whether the pixelized image should be upscaled back to its original size, affecting the final resolution and appearance. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The 'image' parameter represents the input image to be pixelized. It is crucial for defining the base content that will undergo the pixelization process, directly influencing the node's output. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The transformed, pixelized version of the input image, showcasing the applied pixel art effect. Type should be `IMAGE`.
