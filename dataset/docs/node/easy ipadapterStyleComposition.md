- `easy ipadapterStyleComposition`: The `easy ipadapterStyleComposition` node facilitates the application of style and composition adjustments to images using an IPAdapter. It abstracts complex processes into an easier interface, enabling users to modify image aesthetics and composition through predefined or custom settings.
    - Parameters:
        - `preset`: A predefined configuration that sets the baseline for style and composition adjustments, simplifying the selection process for users. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `weight_style`: Determines the intensity of the style adjustment applied to the image, allowing for nuanced control over the aesthetic outcome. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weight_composition`: Controls the degree of composition adjustment, enabling users to fine-tune how elements are blended or arranged. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `expand_style`: A boolean flag that indicates whether to apply the style adjustments more broadly or restrictively across the image. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `combine_embeds`: Defines the method for combining multiple embeddings or adjustments, such as concatenation or averaging, to achieve the desired effect. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_at`: Specifies the starting point for applying adjustments, allowing for targeted modifications within the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_at`: Defines the endpoint for adjustment application, enabling precise control over the area of effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `embeds_scaling`: Adjusts the scaling of embeddings to influence the strength and impact of style and composition adjustments. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `cache_mode`: Sets the caching strategy for the node, optimizing performance and resource usage based on the selected mode. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model to which the IPAdapter style and composition adjustments will be applied, serving as the foundation for the modifications. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `image_style`: Specifies the style image used for style transfer or composition adjustments, providing a visual reference for the desired aesthetic. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_composition`: Optional. The image used for composition adjustments, providing an additional layer for blending or arrangement. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_negative`: Optional. An image that represents undesired aesthetic elements, guiding the adjustment process away from these characteristics. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `attn_mask`: Optional. A mask that highlights specific areas of the image for focused adjustments, enhancing the precision of the application. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `clip_vision`: Optional. Incorporates vision embeddings from CLIP models to guide the style and composition adjustments, enriching the contextual understanding. Type should be `CLIP_VISION`.
        - `optional_ipadapter`: Optional. Specifies an IPAdapter for advanced customization and control over the adjustment process, offering extended capabilities beyond presets. Type should be `IPADAPTER`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The modified model with applied style and composition adjustments, reflecting the desired aesthetic changes. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `ipadapter`: The IPAdapter instance used for the adjustments, encapsulating the specific configurations and modifications made. Type should be `IPADAPTER`.
