- `VHS_VideoInfoSource`: The VHS_VideoInfoSource node is designed to extract and provide detailed information about the source video's characteristics, such as frame rate, frame count, duration, width, and height. It abstracts the complexity of video metadata extraction, offering a straightforward way to access essential video properties for further processing or analysis within the Video Helper Suite.
    - Inputs:
        - `video_info` (Required): The 'video_info' parameter is essential for the operation of this node, as it contains the metadata of the source video from which information like fps, frame count, duration, width, and height are extracted. This metadata is crucial for accurately understanding and manipulating the video content. Type should be `VHS_VIDEOINFO`.
    - Outputs:
        - `fpsðŸŸ¨`: Frames per second of the source video, indicating the video's playback speed. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `frame_countðŸŸ¨`: Total number of frames in the source video. Type should be `INT`.
        - `durationðŸŸ¨`: Total duration of the source video, typically in seconds. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `widthðŸŸ¨`: Width of the video in pixels. Type should be `INT`.
        - `heightðŸŸ¨`: Height of the video in pixels. Type should be `INT`.
