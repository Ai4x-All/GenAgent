- `ADE_LoopedUniformViewOptions`: This node is designed to create view options for generating looped uniform context options in the Animate Diff framework. It configures the parameters for view length, stride, overlap, and whether the loop is closed, alongside the method for fusing context and an option to use on equal length, to tailor the generation process.
    - Parameters:
        - `view_length`: Specifies the length of the view. It determines how many frames or units are considered in a single view, affecting the granularity of the animation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `view_stride`: Defines the stride or step size between views. It affects how smoothly or rapidly the animation transitions between frames. Type should be `INT`.
        - `view_overlap`: Sets the overlap between consecutive views, influencing the continuity and smoothness of the animation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `closed_loop`: Indicates whether the animation should loop back to the beginning, creating a seamless loop effect. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `fuse_method`: Determines the method used to fuse multiple views or contexts together, impacting the overall animation style. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `use_on_equal_length`: A flag to specify if the view options should be applied even when the animation length matches the view length, affecting the animation's versatility. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `view_opts`: Produces the configured view options necessary for generating looped uniform context options within the Animate Diff framework. Type should be `VIEW_OPTS`.
