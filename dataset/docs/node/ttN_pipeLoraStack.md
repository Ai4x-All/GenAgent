- `ttN pipeLoraStack`: The `ttN pipeLoraStack` node is designed to dynamically enhance and modify the capabilities of models and clips by stacking LoRA adjustments based on specified configurations. It allows for the customization of model and clip behavior through the application of learned affine transformations, enabling users to fine-tune their generative processes with precision.
    - Parameters:
        - `toggle`: Determines whether the LoRA stack should be applied or not, acting as a switch to enable or disable the stacking process. Type should be `COMBO[BOOLEAN]`.
        - `mode`: Specifies the mode of operation for LoRA adjustments, distinguishing between simple and advanced configurations for applying model and clip strength modifications. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `num_loras`: Indicates the number of LoRA adjustments to be applied, allowing for multiple layers of modifications to be stacked. Type should be `INT`.
        - `lora_i_name`: Specifies the name of the i-th LoRA adjustment to be applied, enabling the identification and application of specific LoRA transformations. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lora_i_strength`: Defines the strength of the i-th LoRA adjustment for both model and clip in simple mode, allowing for uniform modification intensity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `lora_i_model_strength`: Specifies the strength of the i-th LoRA adjustment applied to the model in advanced mode, enabling differentiated intensity for model transformations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `lora_i_clip_strength`: Specifies the strength of the i-th LoRA adjustment applied to the clip in advanced mode, enabling differentiated intensity for clip transformations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `optional_pipe`: An optional pipeline configuration that can be enhanced with LoRA adjustments if provided; otherwise, a new configuration is generated. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model_override`: Allows for the overriding of the model component within the optional pipeline, facilitating custom model adjustments. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip_override`: Allows for the overriding of the clip component within the optional pipeline, facilitating custom clip adjustments. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `optional_lora_stack`: A pre-defined list of LoRA adjustments that can be optionally included for stacking, offering a way to import existing configurations or add to them. Type should be `LORA_STACK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `optional_pipe`: Returns the enhanced or newly created pipeline configuration after applying the LoRA stack. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `lora_stack`: Provides the list of LoRA adjustments that were applied, detailing the modifications made to the model and clip. Type should be `LORA_STACK`.
