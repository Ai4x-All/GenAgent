- `Int-ðŸ”¬`: The Int node is designed to process and output integer values. It serves as a fundamental logic unit within a system, enabling the manipulation and handling of integer data types for various computational and logical operations.
    - Inputs:
        - `value` (Required): Specifies the integer value to be processed by the node. This parameter is central to the node's operation, as it determines the exact integer data that will be manipulated or evaluated. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `INT`: Outputs the integer value that was input, after any processing. This demonstrates the node's ability to handle and return integer data, maintaining its integrity throughout the operation. Type should be `INT`.
