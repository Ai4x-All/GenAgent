- `Canny`: The Canny node is designed for edge detection in images, utilizing the Canny algorithm to identify and highlight the edges. This process involves applying a series of filters to the input image to detect areas of high gradient, which correspond to edges, thereby enhancing the image's structural details.
    - Parameters:
        - `low_threshold`: The lower threshold for the hysteresis procedure in edge detection. It determines the minimum intensity gradient considered for an edge, affecting the sensitivity of edge detection. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `high_threshold`: The upper threshold for the hysteresis procedure in edge detection. It sets the maximum intensity gradient considered for an edge, influencing the selectivity of edge detection. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be processed for edge detection. It is crucial as it serves as the base for the edge detection operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is an image with highlighted edges, where the edges are detected using the Canny algorithm. This enhances the structural details of the original image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
