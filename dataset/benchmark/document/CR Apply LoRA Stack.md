- `CR Apply LoRA Stack`: The CR_ApplyLoRAStack node is designed to apply a stack of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) modifications to a given model and clip, enhancing or altering their functionalities based on the specified LoRA parameters. It allows for dynamic customization of models through LoRA, facilitating fine-tuned adjustments and optimizations.
    - Inputs:
        - `model` (Required): The model to which the LoRA modifications will be applied. It serves as the base for the adaptations, determining the initial state before any LoRA adjustments. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip` (Required): The clip to which the LoRA modifications will be applied, alongside the model. It represents another aspect of the system that can be adjusted using LoRA parameters for enhanced performance or functionality. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `lora_stack` (Required): A list of LoRA modifications to be applied to the model and clip. Each item in the list specifies a LoRA modification, including its name and the strength of its application to the model and clip. Type should be `LORA_STACK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `MODEL`: The model after the application of the LoRA stack, potentially altered or enhanced by the specified LoRA modifications. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `CLIP`: The clip after the application of the LoRA stack, potentially altered or enhanced alongside the model by the specified LoRA modifications. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `show_help`: A URL providing additional information and guidance on using the CR_ApplyLoRAStack node and its functionalities. Type should be `STRING`.
