- `InstantID Mask Prepare Settings (JPS)`: This node is designed to prepare settings for image masking in the context of InstantID processing. It configures various parameters such as mask type, resizing options, cropping, padding, and image interpolation, tailored to enhance and adjust the input image for optimal InstantID generation.
    - Inputs:
        - `mask_type` (Required): Specifies the type of mask to be applied, such as 'Mask Editor' or 'Red from Image', affecting how the image is processed for InstantID. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `resize_to` (Required): Determines the resizing strategy, like 'Keep Size' or 'Resize to Target', which impacts the dimensions of the processed image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `resize_type` (Required): Defines the method of resizing, either by 'Crop' or 'Stretch', to fit the specified dimensions. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `offset_width` (Required): The horizontal offset applied to the image, adjusting its position relative to the mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `offset_height` (Required): The vertical offset applied to the image, adjusting its position relative to the mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_left` (Required): Specifies the amount to crop from the left edge of the image, customizing its visible area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_right` (Required): Specifies the amount to crop from the right edge of the image, customizing its visible area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_top` (Required): Specifies the amount to crop from the top edge of the image, customizing its visible area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_bottom` (Required): Specifies the amount to crop from the bottom edge of the image, customizing its visible area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `padding_left` (Required): The amount of padding to add on the left side of the image, affecting its final dimensions. Type should be `INT`.
        - `padding_right` (Required): The amount of padding to add on the right side of the image, affecting its final dimensions. Type should be `INT`.
        - `padding_top` (Required): The amount of padding to add on the top side of the image, affecting its final dimensions. Type should be `INT`.
        - `padding_bottom` (Required): The amount of padding to add on the bottom side of the image, affecting its final dimensions. Type should be `INT`.
        - `interpolation` (Required): The method used for resizing the image, such as 'lanczos' or 'bilinear', which influences the quality of the resized image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `sharpening` (Required): The level of sharpening applied to the image, enhancing its clarity and detail. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `imageprepare_settings`: A tuple containing the configured settings for mask type, resizing, cropping, padding, and image processing parameters, ready for use in InstantID image preparation. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
