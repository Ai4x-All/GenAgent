- `InpaintModelConditioning`: This node is designed for conditioning in the context of inpainting tasks, where it likely processes and prepares inputs such as images and masks for inpainting, integrating with VAE models for generating or modifying image content. The node's specific functionality, including how it handles conditioning and interacts with other components like VAEs, remains undefined due to the lack of detailed information in the provided context.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `positive`: Represents the positive conditioning information required for the inpainting process, influencing the generation or modification of image content. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Represents the negative conditioning information, which likely serves to guide the inpainting process by specifying undesired attributes or areas in the generated or modified image content. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `vae`: Specifies the VAE model used in the inpainting process, crucial for encoding or decoding image data. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `pixels`: The input image pixels that are subject to inpainting, serving as the primary content for the node's operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: The mask indicating areas to inpaint, guiding the node in identifying which parts of the image require modification or generation. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `positive`: The processed positive conditioning output, ready for further steps in the inpainting pipeline. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: The processed negative conditioning output, indicating attributes or areas to avoid in the final image content. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent`: The latent representation of the image, potentially modified or generated by the VAE model as part of the inpainting process. Type should be `LATENT`.
