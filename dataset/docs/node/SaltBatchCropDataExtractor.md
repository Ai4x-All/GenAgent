- `SaltBatchCropDataExtractor`: The SaltBatchCropDataExtractor node is designed to process a batch of crop data, extracting specific crop information and dimensions for a given index within the batch. It aims to facilitate the manipulation and analysis of crop data by providing detailed metrics such as width, height, and boundary coordinates.
    - Parameters:
        - `index`: The index within the crop data batch from which to extract crop information. It dictates the specific crop data to be processed. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `crop_data_batch`: The batch of crop data to be processed. It is essential for determining the specific crop information and dimensions to be extracted. Type should be `CROP_DATA_BATCH`.
    - Outputs:
        - `crop_data_batch`: The extracted crop data for the specified index, including size and boundary coordinates. Type should be `CROP_DATA_BATCH`.
        - `width`: The width of the crop area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The height of the crop area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `top`: The top boundary coordinate of the crop area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `left`: The left boundary coordinate of the crop area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `right`: The right boundary coordinate of the crop area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `bottom`: The bottom boundary coordinate of the crop area. Type should be `INT`.
