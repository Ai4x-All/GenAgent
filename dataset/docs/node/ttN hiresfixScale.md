- `ttN hiresfixScale`: The ttN hiresfixScale node specializes in upscaling images through a specific model, enhancing their resolution while optionally adjusting their scale based on various criteria such as percentage increase, maintaining aspect ratio, or targeting a longer side dimension. It integrates advanced rescaling techniques and can output either the upscaled images or their latent representations, depending on the configuration.
    - Parameters:
        - `model_name`: Specifies the model used for upscaling the images, determining the method and quality of the upscale. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `rescale_after_model`: Indicates if the images should be rescaled after being processed by the model. Type should be `COMBO[BOOLEAN]`.
        - `rescale_method`: Defines the method used for rescaling the images after upscaling, such as by percentage or to a specific dimension while maintaining aspect ratio. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `rescale`: Specifies the rescaling approach, either by a fixed percentage or to a specific longer side dimension while preserving aspect ratio. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `percent`: The percentage to scale the image by when 'rescale' is set to 'by percentage'. Type should be `INT`.
        - `width`: The target width for the image after rescaling, applicable when 'rescale' is set to specific dimensions. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The target height for the image after rescaling, applicable when 'rescale' is set to specific dimensions. Type should be `INT`.
        - `longer_side`: Specifies the length of the longer side of the image after rescaling, used when 'rescale' is set to 'to longer side - maintain aspect'. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop`: Determines if and how the image should be cropped after rescaling. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `image_output`: Defines the format of the output, whether as an upscaled image or its latent representation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `save_prefix`: A prefix for saving the processed images, indicating how the output files are named. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `output_latent`: Indicates whether the output should be in the form of latent representations of the upscaled images. Type should be `COMBO[BOOLEAN]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input images to be upscaled, serving as the base for the enhancement process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `vae`: The variational autoencoder used for generating latent representations, if 'output_latent' is true. Type should be `VAE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The latent representation of the upscaled image, if the configuration is set to output in latent format. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `image`: The upscaled and optionally rescaled image, following the specified method and criteria. Type should be `IMAGE`.
