- `SetDefaultImageForSEGS`: This node is designed to set a default image for SEGS (segmentation structures) in scenarios where the original image might be missing or not applicable. It ensures that each segment within the SEGS structure has a consistent and predefined visual representation, facilitating further processing or visualization steps without dependency on the original image data.
    - Inputs:
        - `segs` (Required): The 'segs' input represents the segmentation structures for which a default image is to be set. This input is crucial for identifying the segments that require a default image assignment. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `image` (Required): The 'image' input specifies the default image to be applied across all segments within the SEGS structure. It plays a key role in ensuring visual consistency across segments. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `override` (Required): The 'override' input indicates whether the default image should replace existing images within the SEGS structure, allowing for flexible control over image assignment. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Outputs:
        - `segs`: The output 'segs' consists of the updated segmentation structures with the default image applied, ready for further processing or visualization. Type should be `SEGS`.
