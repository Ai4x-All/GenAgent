- `LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit`: The LayeredDiffusionDecodeSplit node is designed for the specialized task of decoding images in a layered diffusion process, specifically handling split layers. It modifies the sampling process to accommodate different frame rates or sequences, ensuring that each layer is processed appropriately for temporal consistency and visual quality.
    - Inputs:
        - `samples` (Required): A collection of sample data that the node will process, typically representing different states or stages in the diffusion process. This input is crucial for determining how the images are decoded and split across frames. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `images` (Required): A tensor of images that are to be decoded and potentially modified by the node. This input is essential for applying the layered diffusion decoding process to each image in the sequence. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `frames` (Required): The number of frames to be processed, affecting how the samples are sliced and how images are decoded across the sequence. This parameter plays a key role in temporal segmentation of the diffusion process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `sd_version` (Required): Specifies the version of the stable diffusion model to be used, impacting the decoding behavior and the quality of the output images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `sub_batch_size` (Required): Determines the size of sub-batches for processing, influencing the efficiency and speed of the decoding operation. This parameter is important for managing computational resources. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output of the node, consisting of decoded images that have been processed through the layered diffusion technique. This includes modifications for split layers and adjustments for frame rates. Type should be `IMAGE`.
