- `Sharpen (mtb)`: The Sharpen node enhances the visual clarity of images by applying a sharpening effect, utilizing a Gaussian kernel to accentuate edges and details.
    - Inputs:
        - `image` (Required): The input image to be sharpened. This is the primary data upon which the sharpening process is applied, affecting the overall visual outcome. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `sharpen_radius` (Required): Defines the radius of the sharpening effect. A larger radius increases the area of influence around edges, contributing to a more pronounced sharpening effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `sigma_x` (Required): The horizontal standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel. It influences the spread of the sharpening effect horizontally across the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sigma_y` (Required): The vertical standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel. It influences the spread of the sharpening effect vertically across the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `alpha` (Required): Controls the intensity of the sharpening effect. A higher alpha value results in a more aggressive sharpening. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output image after the sharpening process has been applied, showcasing enhanced edges and details. Type should be `IMAGE`.
