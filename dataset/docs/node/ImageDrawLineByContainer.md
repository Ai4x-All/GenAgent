- `ImageDrawLineByContainer`: The ImageDrawLineByContainer node is designed to draw lines on images by specifying the start and end points, color, and other drawing parameters. It abstracts the complexity of image manipulation, allowing for easy integration of line drawing capabilities into image processing workflows.
    - Parameters:
        - `size`: Specifies the thickness of the line to be drawn on the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_x`: The starting x-coordinate for the line. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_y`: The starting y-coordinate for the line. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_x`: The ending x-coordinate for the line. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_y`: The ending y-coordinate for the line. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `red`: The red component of the color of the line. Type should be `INT`.
        - `green`: The green component of the color of the line. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blue`: The blue component of the color of the line. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha`: The alpha (transparency) component of the color of the line. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `SSAA`: Specifies the Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing factor to improve the quality of the line drawing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `method`: Determines the drawing method or algorithm used for line rendering. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `container`: The container parameter represents the image data on which the line will be drawn. It is crucial for determining the dimensions and the canvas for the line drawing. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is an image with the specified line drawn on it. Type should be `IMAGE`.
