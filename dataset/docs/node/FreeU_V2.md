- `FreeU_V2`: The FreeU_V2 node is designed to enhance the flexibility and performance of neural network models by dynamically adjusting their internal processing based on the model's channel configuration and specific scaling factors. It applies sophisticated transformations to the model's output, including scaling and Fourier filtering, to optimize the model's behavior for various computational and application-specific requirements.
    - Parameters:
        - `b1`: A scaling factor that influences the intensity of the transformation applied to the model's output, specifically targeting the higher model channel configurations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `b2`: A scaling factor similar to b1 but tailored for lower model channel configurations, affecting the transformation's intensity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `s1`: A scaling parameter that, along with b1, defines the degree of adjustment applied to the model's output for higher channel configurations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `s2`: A scaling parameter that works in conjunction with b2 to set the adjustment level for lower channel configurations in the model's output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The neural network model to be enhanced and adjusted by the FreeU_V2 node. It serves as the foundation for the node's operations, determining the base architecture that will undergo dynamic scaling and filtering transformations. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The enhanced and dynamically adjusted neural network model, reflecting the applied transformations for optimized performance and flexibility. Type should be `MODEL`.
