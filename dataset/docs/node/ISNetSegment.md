- `ISNetSegment`: ISNetSegment is designed for image segmentation using the ISNet model, capable of processing images to separate foreground from background based on a specified threshold. It supports dynamic model loading, device selection, and optional operation enabling for flexible integration into image processing pipelines.
    - Parameters:
        - `threshold`: The threshold value for segmentation; determines the sensitivity of the segmentation process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `device_mode`: Specifies the computation device preference ('AUTO', 'Prefer GPU', 'CPU') for the segmentation task, allowing for optimized performance. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `enabled`: A flag to enable or disable the segmentation process, providing control over the execution flow. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: Images to be segmented; the core data for segmentation operations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `isnet_model`: An optional ISNet model parameter for segmentation; allows for custom model usage if provided. Type should be `ISNET_MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `segmented`: The segmented images, where the foreground is separated from the background. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: The binary masks indicating the segmented areas in the images. Type should be `MASK`.
