- `Match Dimensions (mtb)`: The MTB_MatchDimensions node is designed to adjust the dimensions of an image to match those of a reference image along a specified dimension (height or width), ensuring the aspect ratio is preserved throughout the process.
    - Parameters:
        - `match`: Specifies whether the matching should be done based on the height or width of the reference image. This choice influences the resizing strategy and the final aspect ratio of the source image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `source`: The source image to be resized. It plays a crucial role in determining the new dimensions while preserving the aspect ratio. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `reference`: The reference image whose dimensions are used as the target for resizing the source image. It dictates the final dimensions to aim for, guiding the resizing process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resized image with dimensions matched to the reference image, maintaining the original aspect ratio. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `new_width`: The new width of the resized image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `new_height`: The new height of the resized image. Type should be `INT`.
