- `INPAINT_ApplyFooocusInpaint`: This node applies a specialized inpainting technique using the Fooocus method to enhance or modify images by integrating specific patches into the model's processing pipeline. It leverages a combination of model patching and latent space manipulation to achieve targeted inpainting effects, focusing on areas designated by noise masks.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model to be patched with inpainting capabilities, allowing for the integration of Fooocus patches into its processing pipeline. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `patch`: A tuple containing the inpaint head model and a dictionary of LoRA patches, which are applied to the base model to achieve inpainting effects. Type should be `INPAINT_PATCH`.
        - `latent`: A dictionary containing the latent representations and noise masks used to guide the inpainting process, influencing where and how inpainting is applied. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The model after applying the Fooocus inpainting patches, ready for further processing or generating inpainted images. Type should be `MODEL`.
