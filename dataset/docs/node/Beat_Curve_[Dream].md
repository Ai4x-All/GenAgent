- `Beat Curve [Dream]`: The Beat Curve node generates animation curves based on musical beats, allowing for synchronization between visual animations and rhythmic elements of a soundtrack. It utilizes BPM (beats per minute), measure length, and optional accents to create dynamic, beat-aligned animations.
    - Parameters:
        - `bpm`: Specifies the beats per minute of the music track, influencing the timing of the animation curve to match the rhythm. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `time_offset`: Adjusts the start time of the animation curve, allowing for precise synchronization with the music track. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `measure_length`: Defines the length of a musical measure in beats, used to calculate the timing of accents within the animation curve. Type should be `INT`.
        - `low_value`: Sets the minimum value of the animation curve, defining the lower bound of the generated values. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `high_value`: Sets the maximum value of the animation curve, defining the upper bound of the generated values. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `invert`: Inverts the animation curve, flipping the generated values between the specified low and high values. This parameter accepts 'yes' or 'no' to indicate inversion. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `power`: Applies a power function to the animation curve, adjusting the intensity and dynamics of the curve's progression. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `accent_i`: Specifies an accent beat within a measure, enhancing the animation curve's response to musical rhythm. Accents range from 1 to the measure length, allowing for dynamic rhythm customization. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `frame_counter`: Provides the current frame and timing information necessary for calculating the animation curve in relation to the music's beat. Type should be `FRAME_COUNTER`.
    - Outputs:
        - `FLOAT`: The floating-point value of the animation curve at the current frame, reflecting the rhythmic pattern. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `INT`: The integer-rounded value of the animation curve at the current frame, suitable for discrete animations. Type should be `INT`.
