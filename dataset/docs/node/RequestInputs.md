- `RequestInputs`: The RequestInputs node is designed to accept a JSON string of key-value pairs, parse it, and output the values as a tuple of strings. This node serves as a foundational component in processing and transforming input data received in JSON format into a more manageable and usable form for subsequent nodes in a pipeline.
    - Parameters:
        - `values`: The 'values' parameter takes a JSON string containing key-value pairs. It plays a crucial role in the node's operation by providing the raw data that will be parsed and transformed into a tuple of strings, which are then passed on for further processing. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `string`: Outputs a tuple of strings extracted from the input JSON string. Each element of the tuple represents a value from the key-value pairs in the input JSON, making it easier to handle and process the data further. Type should be `STRING`.
