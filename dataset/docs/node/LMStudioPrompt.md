- `LMStudioPrompt`: The LMStudioPrompt node is designed to generate prompts using the LM Studio API, offering an alternative approach to prompt generation that leverages the capabilities of LM Studio.
    - Parameters:
        - `input_prompt`: The 'input_prompt' parameter serves as the initial input text for the node, which is then processed and enhanced using the LM Studio API to generate a new prompt. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `mode`: This parameter specifies the mode of operation for the node, affecting how the prompt is processed and generated. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `custom_history`: Custom history allows for the inclusion of additional context or information in the prompt generation process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `server_address`: Specifies the server address where the LM Studio API is hosted, enabling the node to connect and utilize its services. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `server_port`: Defines the port on the server to which the node connects for accessing the LM Studio API. Type should be `INT`.
        - `seed`: The 'seed' parameter is used to introduce determinism in the prompt generation process, ensuring that the same input produces the same output across different runs. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `text`: This output is the enhanced prompt generated by the LMStudioPrompt node, ready for further processing or use. Type should be `STRING`.
