- `FadeMaskEdges`: This node is designed to premultiply and alpha blend the edges of a subject to prevent outer pixels from creeping in. It is particularly useful for stylized subjects, such as drawings with black outlines, by allowing for different edge fades to optimize the blending of the subject into its background.
    - Parameters:
        - `edge_size`: Defines the size of the edge fade, influencing how the subject's edges blend into the background. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `edge_tightness`: Controls the tightness of the edge fade, affecting the transition smoothness from the subject to the background. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `edge_exponent`: Determines the fade curve, allowing for customization of the edge transition effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `smoothing_diameter`: Specifies the diameter for edge smoothing, used to refine the blending effect post-premultiplication and alpha setting. Type should be `INT`.
        - `paste_original_blacks`: A boolean flag indicating whether to paste original black pixels back into the image, aiding in preserving the subject's integrity. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `binary_image`: The binary image to be processed, focusing on premultiplying and alpha blending its edges. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The processed image with premultiplied and alpha blended edges, ready for further use or display. Type should be `IMAGE`.
