- `PromptScheduleEncodeSDXL`: This node is designed to schedule and encode prompts specifically for the SDXL model, allowing for separate scheduling of G and L clips before tokenization. It processes these clips through an add_weighted mechanism to return the current, next, or averaged conditioning, facilitating dynamic and flexible text input manipulation for generative tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: Specifies the width of the image or canvas in pixels, setting the spatial dimension for the generation process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Specifies the height of the image or canvas in pixels, setting the spatial dimension for the generation process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_w`: Defines the width of the crop area in pixels, allowing for focused generation within a specified region of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_h`: Defines the height of the crop area in pixels, allowing for focused generation within a specified region of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `target_width`: Sets the target width for the output image, enabling resizing of the generated image to fit specific dimensions. Type should be `INT`.
        - `target_height`: Sets the target height for the output image, enabling resizing of the generated image to fit specific dimensions. Type should be `INT`.
        - `text_g`: Represents the global text prompt that guides the overall theme or subject of the generation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_l`: Represents the local text prompt that provides detailed guidance for specific areas or aspects of the generation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `max_frames`: Defines the maximum number of frames for animation or video generation, setting the temporal boundary for the project. Type should be `INT`.
        - `current_frame`: Specifies the current frame number in the context of an animation or video generation, dictating the specific moment being processed. Type should be `INT`.
        - `print_output`: Enables or disables the printing of output for debugging or tracking purposes, offering insights into the generation process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `pre_text_G`: Specifies the text to be prepended to the global prompt, modifying the initial conditions of the generation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `app_text_G`: Specifies the text to be appended to the global prompt, modifying the final conditions of the generation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `pre_text_L`: Specifies the text to be prepended to the local prompt, modifying the initial conditions of the generation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `app_text_L`: Specifies the text to be appended to the local prompt, modifying the final conditions of the generation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `pw_a`: Parameter weight A, part of a set of weights used to adjust the influence of different components in the generation process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_b`: Parameter weight B, part of a set of weights used to adjust the influence of different components in the generation process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_c`: Parameter weight C, part of a set of weights used to adjust the influence of different components in the generation process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_d`: Parameter weight D, part of a set of weights used to adjust the influence of different components in the generation process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip`: Specifies the CLIP model to be used for encoding the text prompts, influencing the direction of the generation. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `POS`: The encoded positive conditioning, ready for use in generative tasks, reflecting the emphasized aspects of the input prompt. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `NEG`: The encoded negative conditioning, ready for use in generative tasks, reflecting the de-emphasized aspects of the input prompt. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
