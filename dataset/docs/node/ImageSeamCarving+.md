- `ImageSeamCarving+`: The ImageSeamCarving node is designed for dynamically resizing images while preserving their essential content features. It employs seam carving techniques to selectively remove or add pixels in paths (seams) across the image, taking into consideration content importance indicated by energy maps, and optionally, keep and drop masks to protect or remove specific areas.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: The target width for the resized image. This parameter dictates the new width dimension the image should be resized to, influencing the number of seams to be carved or added. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The target height for the resized image. Similar to width, this parameter sets the new height dimension for the image, affecting the seam carving process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `energy`: Specifies the energy calculation mode to determine the importance of pixels in the image. This mode influences which pixels are prioritized for removal or retention during the resizing process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `order`: Determines the order in which seams are processed (e.g., width-first or height-first), affecting the direction and strategy of the seam carving operation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be processed for seam carving. It serves as the primary data on which the seam carving algorithm operates, dynamically resizing the image while preserving or discarding content as specified by other parameters. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `keep_mask`: An optional mask to indicate areas of the image that should be preserved during the seam carving process. It helps in protecting specific content from being altered or removed. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `drop_mask`: An optional mask to specify areas of the image that can be preferentially removed during the resizing process. It is used to target less important areas for seam removal. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output image after seam carving. It is the resized version of the input image, adjusted according to the specified parameters and preserving or discarding content as directed. Type should be `IMAGE`.
