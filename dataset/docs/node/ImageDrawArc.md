- `ImageDrawArc`: The ImageDrawArc node is designed for drawing arcs on images. It leverages parameters such as dimensions, color, and arc specifics to render arcs directly onto a given image canvas, facilitating the creation of graphical representations and annotations.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: Specifies the width of the image canvas where the arc will be drawn. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Specifies the height of the image canvas where the arc will be drawn. Type should be `INT`.
        - `size`: Determines the thickness of the arc line. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_x`: The starting x-coordinate for the arc on the image canvas. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_y`: The starting y-coordinate for the arc on the image canvas. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_x`: The ending x-coordinate for the arc on the image canvas. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_y`: The ending y-coordinate for the arc on the image canvas. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start`: The starting angle of the arc. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end`: The ending angle of the arc. Type should be `INT`.
        - `red`: The red component of the arc's color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `green`: The green component of the arc's color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blue`: The blue component of the arc's color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha`: The alpha (transparency) component of the arc's color. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `SSAA`: Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing factor for higher quality rendering. Type should be `INT`.
        - `method`: The method used for resizing the image after drawing the arc, affecting the final image quality. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: Returns the image tensor with the drawn arc. Type should be `IMAGE`.
