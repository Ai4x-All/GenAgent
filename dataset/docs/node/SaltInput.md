- `SaltInput`: The SaltInput node is designed to facilitate the creation and configuration of inputs for workflows within the Salt AI platform. It allows users to define various aspects of an input, such as its name, description, type, and default value, along with additional properties like allowed values, whether user override is required, and if the path should be considered relative. This node plays a crucial role in customizing and streamlining the input process for different types of data, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in workflow design.
    - Parameters:
        - `input_name`: Specifies the name of the input, serving as a unique identifier and label for the input field within the workflow. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `input_desc`: Provides a description for the input, offering context or instructions for the user on how to provide the input value. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `input_type`: Defines the type of the input, such as STRING, FLOAT, INT, etc., dictating the expected format and nature of the data to be provided by the user. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `input_value`: The default value for the input, which can be pre-filled but is subject to change by the user. Supports multiline strings and is designed for dynamic input scenarios. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `input_allowed_values`: Specifies a string of allowed values for the input, guiding the user in providing valid data and ensuring input integrity. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `user_override_required`: Determines whether the user must provide an override for the default input value, ensuring user interaction and validation for critical inputs. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `relative_path`: Indicates whether the provided input path should be treated as relative, affecting how the input data is accessed and managed. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `input_image`: An optional parameter for providing an image as input, enhancing the node's capability to handle visual data types. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `input_mask`: An optional parameter for providing a mask as input, useful in scenarios requiring specific areas of an image to be identified or processed. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `value`: unknown Type should be `*`.
