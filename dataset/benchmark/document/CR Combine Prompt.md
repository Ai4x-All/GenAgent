- `CR Combine Prompt`: The CR_CombinePrompt node is designed to concatenate multiple string inputs into a single string output, using a specified separator. This functionality is useful for dynamically constructing prompts or text sequences in a flexible manner.
    - Inputs:
        - `part1` (Optional): The first part of the prompt to be combined. It contributes to the beginning of the final concatenated string. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `part2` (Optional): The second part of the prompt to be combined. It is appended after the first part, separated by the specified separator. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `part3` (Optional): The third part of the prompt to be combined. It follows the second part, further extending the concatenated string. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `part4` (Optional): The fourth and final part of the prompt to be combined. It concludes the concatenated string. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `separator` (Optional): The string used to separate each part of the prompt in the final concatenated output. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `prompt`: The final concatenated string resulting from combining the specified parts with the separator. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `show_help`: A URL providing additional help and documentation related to the node's functionality. Type should be `STRING`.
