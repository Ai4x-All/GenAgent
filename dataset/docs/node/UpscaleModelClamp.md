- `UpscaleModelClamp`: The UpscaleModelClamp node is designed to pass through upscale models without modification, serving as a placeholder or checkpoint within a processing pipeline that involves model manipulation.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `upscale_model`: The upscale model to be passed through the node. It acts as a direct input for potential further processing or utilization within the pipeline. Type should be `UPSCALE_MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `upscale_model`: The unaltered upscale model that was input into the node, facilitating seamless integration into subsequent stages of the pipeline. Type should be `UPSCALE_MODEL`.
