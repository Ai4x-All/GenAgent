- `IPAdapterWeights`: The IPAdapterWeights node is designed to manage and manipulate weights within the IPAdapter framework, providing a foundational structure for weight strategy implementation and optional image-based adjustments.
    - Parameters:
        - `weights`: A string of comma or newline-separated values representing the weights to be applied, which can be adjusted based on the strategy. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `timing`: Defines the timing strategy for applying weights, offering various options such as custom, linear, ease_in_out, etc. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `frames`: Specifies the number of frames to which the weights will be applied, influencing the animation or transition effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_frame`: The starting frame from which weight application begins, allowing for precise control over the animation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_frame`: The ending frame at which weight application stops, defining the scope of the animation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `add_starting_frames`: Additional frames added at the beginning of the animation, extending the initial state. Type should be `INT`.
        - `add_ending_frames`: Additional frames added at the end of the animation, extending the final state. Type should be `INT`.
        - `method`: The method of applying weights across frames, such as full batch, shift batches, or alternate batches, affecting the animation's flow. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: An optional parameter that allows for image-based adjustments to weights, enhancing the flexibility and applicability of the weight strategy. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `weights`: The adjusted weights after applying the specified strategy and adjustments. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weights_invert`: The inverted weights calculated from the original weights, providing an alternative perspective. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `total_frames`: The total number of frames resulting from the applied weights and additional frame adjustments. Type should be `INT`.
        - `image_1`: The first image in a pair used for certain weight application methods, particularly in batch shifting or alternation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_2`: The second image in a pair used alongside image_1 for specific weight application methods. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `weights_strategy`: The comprehensive strategy used for weight application, including all specified parameters and their effects. Type should be `WEIGHTS_STRATEGY`.
