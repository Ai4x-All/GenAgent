- `RegionalSeedExplorerColorMask __Inspire`: This node specializes in exploring seed variations within a specific region defined by a color mask. It applies modifications to the noise pattern based on seed prompts and additional seed information, allowing for targeted adjustments in the generation process.
    - Parameters:
        - `mask_color`: The specific color in the mask that identifies the target region for applying seed variations. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `seed_prompt`: A comma-separated list of seed prompts that guide the variations to be applied within the defined region. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `enable_additional`: A flag indicating whether additional seed information should be considered in the exploration process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `additional_seed`: An additional seed value to be included in the exploration process, providing further customization. Type should be `INT`.
        - `additional_strength`: The strength of the influence of the additional seed on the exploration process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `noise_mode`: Specifies whether the noise processing should occur on the CPU or GPU, affecting performance and resource utilization. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `color_mask`: The color mask used to define the region of interest for seed exploration. It determines where the seed variations will be applied. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `noise`: The initial noise pattern to which the seed variations will be applied. It serves as the base for generating targeted adjustments. Type should be `NOISE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `noise`: The modified noise pattern after applying the seed variations and additional seed information. Type should be `NOISE`.
        - `mask`: The original color mask used to define the target region, returned for reference or further processing. Type should be `MASK`.
