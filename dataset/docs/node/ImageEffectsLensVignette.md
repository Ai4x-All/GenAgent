- `ImageEffectsLensVignette`: The `ImageEffectsLensVignette` node applies a vignette effect to images, simulating the reduction in brightness or saturation at the periphery compared to the image center. This effect mimics the characteristic appearance of photographs taken with certain types of camera lenses, adding a sense of depth or focus to the central subject of the image.
    - Parameters:
        - `lens_shape`: Defines the shape of the vignette effect, influencing how the brightness or saturation fades towards the edges of the image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lens_edge`: Specifies the edge behavior of the vignette effect, determining how the effect is applied around or symmetrically across the image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lens_curvy`: Adjusts the curvature of the vignette effect, allowing for more creative control over the transition from center to edge. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `lens_zoom`: Controls the zoom level of the vignette effect, affecting the area of the image that remains unaffected by the vignetting. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `brightness`: Adjusts the overall brightness of the image, enhancing the visual impact of the vignette effect by modifying the light levels. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `saturation`: Modifies the saturation level of the image, complementing the vignette effect by altering the intensity of colors. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The input images to which the vignette effect will be applied. This parameter is crucial for defining the base content that will undergo the transformation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting image after applying the vignette effect, showcasing the enhanced focus on the central subject through the controlled fading of edges. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: The mask used to apply the vignette effect, indicating the areas of the image affected by the transformation. Type should be `MASK`.
