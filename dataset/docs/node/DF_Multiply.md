- `DF_Multiply`: The `DF_Multiply` node performs multiplication of two floating-point numbers, providing a straightforward way to calculate the product of two values within a mathematical or computational workflow.
    - Parameters:
        - `Value_A`: `Value_A` represents the first floating-point number to be multiplied. It plays a crucial role in determining the overall result of the multiplication operation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `Value_B`: `Value_B` is the second floating-point number involved in the multiplication. Its value directly influences the product outcome, making it an essential component of the operation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `float`: The output is a floating-point number representing the product of the two input values, `Value_A` and `Value_B`. It encapsulates the result of the multiplication operation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
