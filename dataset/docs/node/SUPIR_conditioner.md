- `SUPIR_conditioner`: The SUPIR_conditioner node is designed to condition the input data for the SUPIR model, preparing it for further processing or generation tasks. It integrates various conditioning elements, such as positive and negative prompts, to tailor the model's output towards specific desired outcomes.
    - Parameters:
        - `positive_prompt`: A text prompt that guides the model to generate or process data in a positive or desired direction, influencing the conditioning outcome. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `negative_prompt`: A text prompt that guides the model to avoid certain patterns or themes, acting as a counterbalance to the positive prompt in the conditioning process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `captions`: Optional captions that can provide additional context or guidance for the conditioning process, further customizing the output. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `SUPIR_model`: Represents the SUPIR model to which the conditioning is applied, serving as the core component for the conditioning process. Type should be `SUPIRMODEL`.
        - `latents`: The latent representations of the input data, which are modified or utilized during the conditioning process to influence the model's output. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `positive`: The conditioned data tailored for positive outcomes, ready for further processing by the SUPIR model. Type should be `SUPIR_cond_pos`.
        - `negative`: The conditioned data tailored to avoid certain patterns or themes, serving as a counterbalance in the generation process. Type should be `SUPIR_cond_neg`.
