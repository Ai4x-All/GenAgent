- `ImageContainerInheritanceSum`: This node is designed to handle the summation of image dimensions within a container, facilitating operations that require combining multiple images into a single composite image. It abstracts the complexity of image dimension calculations and adjustments, making it easier to work with image collections in a unified manner.
    - Parameters:
        - `red`: The red color component value used in the image processing, affecting the visual outcome. Type should be `INT`.
        - `green`: The green color component value used in the image processing, affecting the visual outcome. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blue`: The blue color component value used in the image processing, affecting the visual outcome. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha`: The alpha (transparency) value used in the image processing, affecting the visual outcome. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `container_size_type`: Specifies the method for calculating the container size, influencing the dimensions of the resulting composite image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `method`: Specifies the method of image processing to be applied, influencing how images are combined or manipulated. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images_a`: One of the collections of images to be processed, playing a key role in determining the overall dimensions of the resulting composite image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `images_b`: The other collection of images to be processed, contributing to the overall dimensions of the resulting composite image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting composite image after processing. Type should be `IMAGE`.
