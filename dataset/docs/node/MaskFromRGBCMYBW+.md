- `MaskFromRGBCMYBW+`: This node is designed to generate masks based on specific RGB, CMY, and BW (Black and White) values within images. It abstracts the complexity of color space conversions and thresholding operations to provide a straightforward way for users to create masks that highlight or isolate particular color ranges or intensity levels in images.
    - Parameters:
        - `threshold_r`: Specifies the threshold for the red component used to filter the image and generate the mask. This parameter helps in isolating areas based on the red intensity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `threshold_g`: Specifies the threshold for the green component used to filter the image and generate the mask. This parameter helps in isolating areas based on the green intensity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `threshold_b`: Specifies the threshold for the blue component used to filter the image and generate the mask. This parameter helps in isolating areas based on the blue intensity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `remove_isolated_pixels`: Determines whether to remove isolated pixels from the generated masks, enhancing the mask's clarity and relevance to the targeted colors or intensity levels. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_holes`: Indicates whether to fill holes in the generated masks, ensuring a more continuous and useful mask for further image processing or analysis. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The 'image' parameter is the input image from which the mask will be generated. It plays a crucial role in determining the areas of interest based on the specified color or intensity values. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `red`: The output mask isolating the red components based on the specified threshold and processing parameters. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `green`: The output mask isolating the green components based on the specified threshold and processing parameters. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `blue`: The output mask isolating the blue components based on the specified threshold and processing parameters. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `cyan`: The output mask isolating the cyan components based on the specified threshold and processing parameters. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `magenta`: The output mask isolating the magenta components based on the specified threshold and processing parameters. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `yellow`: The output mask isolating the yellow components based on the specified threshold and processing parameters. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `black`: The output mask isolating the black components based on the specified threshold and processing parameters. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `white`: The output mask isolating the white components based on the specified threshold and processing parameters. Type should be `MASK`.
