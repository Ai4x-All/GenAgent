        - `text1`: The first text option to choose from. This input is part of the conditional operation, selected when the boolean condition is true. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text2`: The second text option to choose from. This input is part of the conditional operation, selected when the boolean condition is false. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `STRING`: The output text, selected based on the boolean condition. It dynamically switches between text1 and text2. Type should be `STRING`.
