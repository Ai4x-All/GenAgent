- `Sampler Scheduler Settings (JPS)`: This node is designed to facilitate the selection and configuration of samplers and schedulers within a generative pipeline, allowing users to specify and retrieve the settings for various sampling strategies and their corresponding scheduling algorithms.
    - Inputs:
        - `sampler_name` (Required): Specifies the name of the sampler to be used, playing a crucial role in determining the sampling strategy for the generative process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler` (Required): Determines the scheduling algorithm to be applied, directly affecting the execution and efficiency of the sampling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Outputs:
        - `sampler_name`: Returns the name of the selected sampler. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Returns the selected scheduling algorithm. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
