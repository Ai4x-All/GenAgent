- `ImageDrawEllipse`: The ImageDrawEllipse node is designed for drawing ellipses on images. It allows for customization of the ellipse's appearance, including its outline and fill colors, as well as its size and position on the canvas, leveraging supersampling anti-aliasing (SSAA) for higher quality rendering.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: Specifies the width of the canvas on which the ellipse will be drawn, affecting the overall dimensions of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Specifies the height of the canvas, influencing the vertical dimension of the image and the ellipse's potential size. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_x`: Specifies the starting x-coordinate of the ellipse on the image, playing a key role in defining the ellipse's position. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_y`: Specifies the starting y-coordinate of the ellipse, crucial for positioning the ellipse on the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_x`: Defines the ending x-coordinate of the ellipse, determining its width and contributing to its overall shape. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_y`: Defines the ending y-coordinate of the ellipse, determining its height and contributing to its overall shape. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `outline_size`: Determines the thickness of the ellipse's outline, affecting the visual prominence of the ellipse on the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_red`: Specifies the red component of the ellipse's outline color, contributing to the color customization. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_green`: Specifies the green component of the ellipse's outline color, contributing to the color customization. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_blue`: Specifies the blue component of the ellipse's outline color, contributing to the color customization. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_alpha`: Determines the opacity of the ellipse's outline, allowing for transparency effects. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `fill_red`: Specifies the red component of the ellipse's fill color, enabling color customization of the fill. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_green`: Specifies the green component of the ellipse's fill color, enabling color customization of the fill. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_blue`: Specifies the blue component of the ellipse's fill color, enabling color customization of the fill. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_alpha`: Determines the opacity of the ellipse's fill, allowing for transparency effects in the fill color. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `SSAA`: Specifies the level of supersampling anti-aliasing (SSAA) applied, enhancing the quality of the ellipse's rendering. Type should be `INT`.
        - `method`: Defines the method used for resizing the image after drawing the ellipse, affecting the final image quality. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: Returns the image tensor with the drawn ellipse, showcasing the customized appearance as specified by the input parameters. Type should be `IMAGE`.
