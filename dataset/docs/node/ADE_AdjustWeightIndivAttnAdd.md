- `ADE_AdjustWeightIndivAttnAdd`: This node is designed to adjust the weights of individual attention components in an animation differential setting by adding specified values. It allows for fine-tuning of the attention mechanism's parameters to achieve desired animation effects.
    - Parameters:
        - `pe_ADD`: Specifies the amount to be added to the positional encoding weights, influencing the animation's spatial transformations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attn_ADD`: Determines the addition to the overall attention weights, affecting how the model's attention mechanism prioritizes different parts of the input. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attn_q_ADD`: Adjusts the query weights in the attention mechanism by adding the specified value, impacting the calculation of attention scores. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attn_k_ADD`: Modifies the key weights in the attention mechanism through addition, influencing how keys and queries interact. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attn_v_ADD`: Alters the value weights in the attention mechanism by addition, affecting the output of the attention calculation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attn_out_weight_ADD`: Specifies the addition to the attention output weights, impacting the final attention output before it's passed to subsequent layers. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attn_out_bias_ADD`: Adjusts the bias added to the attention output, fine-tuning the attention mechanism's output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `other_ADD`: Specifies the amount to be added to other unspecified weights, allowing for general adjustments outside the main attention components. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `print_adjustment`: Controls whether the adjustments made are printed out, aiding in debugging and fine-tuning processes. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `prev_weight_adjust`: Allows for the chaining of weight adjustments by taking a previous adjustment group as input, enabling cumulative adjustments. Type should be `WEIGHT_ADJUST`.
    - Outputs:
        - `weight_adjust`: Returns an updated weight adjustment group, incorporating the specified individual attention and other adjustments. Type should be `WEIGHT_ADJUST`.
