- `BatchPromptScheduleEncodeSDXL`: This node is designed to process and schedule G and L clips separately before tokenization, applying an add_weighted process to generate a batch of conditionings. It focuses on handling and transforming input prompts into scheduled outputs, optimizing the conditioning process for batch operations.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: Specifies the desired width for the output conditioning, affecting the dimensionality of the processed batch. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Specifies the desired height for the output conditioning, affecting the dimensionality of the processed batch. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_w`: Determines the width of the crop to be applied to the input, influencing the focus area of the conditioning process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_h`: Determines the height of the crop to be applied to the input, influencing the focus area of the conditioning process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `target_width`: Defines the target width for the final output, impacting the resolution of the conditioned batch. Type should be `INT`.
        - `target_height`: Defines the target height for the final output, impacting the resolution of the conditioned batch. Type should be `INT`.
        - `text_g`: The G clip text input that will be processed and scheduled, contributing to the generation of the conditioning batch. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_l`: The L clip text input that will be processed and scheduled alongside the G clip, contributing to the diversity of the conditioning batch. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `max_frames`: Specifies the maximum number of frames to be considered for scheduling, influencing the temporal aspect of the conditioning process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `print_output`: A flag indicating whether to print the output for debugging or logging purposes, affecting the verbosity of the process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `pre_text_G`: Pre-text for the G clip, used to prepend to the input text for further customization of the conditioning. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `app_text_G`: Appended text for the G clip, used to append to the input text for additional customization. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `pre_text_L`: Pre-text for the L clip, used in a similar manner to the G clip for enhancing the input conditioning. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `app_text_L`: Appended text for the L clip, serving the same purpose as for the G clip, enriching the input for a more tailored conditioning. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `pw_a`: Weight parameter A, part of a set of weights used in the add_weighted process to fine-tune the conditioning output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_b`: Weight parameter B, works alongside other weight parameters to adjust the emphasis of the conditioning process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_c`: Weight parameter C, contributes to the balance and distribution of weights in the conditioning output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_d`: Weight parameter D, finalizes the set of weights for precise control over the conditioning outcome. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip`: The CLIP model used for tokenization and encoding of the input texts, central to the conditioning process. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `POS`: The processed output that emphasizes the positive aspects of the conditioned batch, reflecting the scheduled and weighted transformation of the input. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `NEG`: The processed output that emphasizes the negative aspects of the conditioned batch, showcasing the scheduled and weighted transformation of the input to provide a balanced perspective. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
