        - `max_turns` (Required): Specifies the maximum number of message exchanges allowed in the chat, controlling the conversation's length. Type should be `INT`.
        - `func_call_filter` (Required): Determines if the next speaker is chosen based on function call suggestions, influencing the flow of conversation. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `speaker_selection_method` (Required): Specifies the method used to select the next speaker, affecting the dynamics of the conversation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `allow_repeat_speaker` (Required): Allows or disallows the same speaker to be chosen consecutively, impacting the variety of conversation. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `send_introductions` (Required): Controls whether introductory messages are sent at the beginning of the chat, setting the stage for the conversation. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
