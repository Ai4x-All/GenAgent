- `GetImageSize+`: This node is designed to determine the dimensions of an image, specifically its width and height. It abstracts the process of accessing and interpreting the image's shape to provide a straightforward way to obtain its size.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The image for which the size is to be determined. This parameter is essential for the node to execute its function of calculating the image's dimensions. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `width`: The width of the input image, measured in pixels. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The height of the input image, measured in pixels. Type should be `INT`.
