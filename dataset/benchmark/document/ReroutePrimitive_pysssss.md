- `ReroutePrimitive_pysssss`: The ReroutePrimitive node is designed to pass through any given input without modification, acting as a universal connector in data flow architectures. It abstracts away the complexity of data types, allowing for flexible rerouting of data streams.
    - Inputs:
        - `value` (Required): The 'value' parameter serves as the universal input that the node will pass through unchanged. It is central to the node's functionality, enabling it to act as a versatile connector in various data processing scenarios. Type should be `*`.
    - Outputs:
        - `*`: The output is a tuple containing the unchanged input value, facilitating seamless data rerouting. Type should be `*`.
