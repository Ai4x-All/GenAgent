- `MaskFromSegmentation+`: The node is designed to generate a mask based on image segmentation, facilitating the extraction of specific features or objects from an image by identifying and isolating them through segmentation techniques.
    - Parameters:
        - `segments`: Specifies the segments to be used for mask creation, allowing for targeted extraction within the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `remove_isolated_pixels`: A boolean flag to remove isolated pixels in the generated mask, enhancing mask quality by eliminating noise. Type should be `INT`.
        - `remove_small_masks`: A boolean flag to remove small masks from the generated mask, focusing on significant segments by filtering out minor ones. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `fill_holes`: A boolean flag to fill holes in the generated mask, ensuring a more continuous and coherent mask output. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image for segmentation, serving as the basis for mask generation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The output mask generated from the specified image segments, isolating desired features or objects. Type should be `MASK`.
