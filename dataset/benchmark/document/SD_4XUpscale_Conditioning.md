- `SD_4XUpscale_Conditioning`: This node specializes in enhancing the resolution of images through a 4x upscale process, incorporating conditioning elements to refine the output. It leverages diffusion techniques to upscale images while allowing for the adjustment of scale ratio and noise augmentation to fine-tune the enhancement process.
    - Inputs:
        - `images` (Required): The input images to be upscaled. This parameter is crucial as it directly influences the quality and resolution of the output images. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `positive` (Required): Positive conditioning elements that guide the upscale process towards desired attributes or features in the output images. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative` (Required): Negative conditioning elements that the upscale process should avoid, helping to steer the output away from undesired attributes or features. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `scale_ratio` (Required): Determines the factor by which the image resolution is increased. A higher scale ratio results in a larger output image, allowing for greater detail and clarity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `noise_augmentation` (Required): Controls the level of noise augmentation applied during the upscale process. This can be used to introduce variability and improve the robustness of the output images. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `positive`: The refined positive conditioning elements resulting from the upscale process. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: The refined negative conditioning elements resulting from the upscale process. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent`: A latent representation generated during the upscale process, which can be utilized in further processing or model training. Type should be `LATENT`.
