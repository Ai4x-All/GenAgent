- `RIFE VFI`: The RIFE_VFI node is designed for video frame interpolation, leveraging deep learning models to predict and generate intermediate frames between existing ones in a video sequence. This process enhances video fluidity and can be used for slow-motion effects, video restoration, or improving frame rates.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: Specifies the checkpoint name of the model to be used for frame interpolation, affecting the quality and style of the generated frames. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clear_cache_after_n_frames`: Indicates after how many frames the cache should be cleared to prevent memory overflow, optimizing resource usage during processing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `multiplier`: Defines the number of intermediate frames to be generated between each pair of original frames, directly influencing the smoothness of the output video. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fast_mode`: A boolean flag that, when enabled, allows the interpolation process to run in a faster mode at the possible expense of some quality. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `ensemble`: A boolean parameter that, when true, enables the use of ensemble methods for improved frame interpolation quality. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `scale_factor`: Determines the scale factor for resizing frames during the interpolation process, affecting the resolution of the output frames. Type should be `COMBO[FLOAT]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `frames`: The input video frames to be interpolated, provided as a tensor. This is the core data on which frame interpolation is performed. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `optional_interpolation_states`: Provides optional states for controlling the interpolation process, allowing for advanced customization of frame generation. Type should be `INTERPOLATION_STATES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output of the interpolation process, consisting of the original and newly generated intermediate frames, enhancing the fluidity of the video sequence. Type should be `IMAGE`.
