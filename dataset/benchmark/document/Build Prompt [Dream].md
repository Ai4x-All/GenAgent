- `Build Prompt [Dream]`: The 'Build Prompt' node is designed for constructing and weighting textual prompts for generative tasks, allowing for the dynamic adjustment of prompt importance through weights.
    - Inputs:
        - `added_prompt` (Required): Specifies the text to be added to the prompt, which can be dynamically adjusted in importance using the weight parameter. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `weight` (Required): Determines the weight of the added prompt text, influencing its significance in the resulting prompt composition. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `partial_prompt` (Optional): An optional initial prompt structure that can be further modified by adding text with specified weight. If not provided, a new prompt structure is initialized. Type should be `PARTIAL_PROMPT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `partial_prompt`: The modified or newly created prompt structure, incorporating the added text with its specified weight. Type should be `PARTIAL_PROMPT`.
