- `LLMAgentExecutor`: The LLMAgentExecutor node is designed to orchestrate the execution of language model agents within a given environment, leveraging a combination of user queries, document contexts, and model configurations to generate responses or actions. It integrates various components such as file creation, user simulation, and context management to facilitate complex interactions and generate outputs based on the specified parameters.
    - Inputs:
        - `llm_model` (Required): Specifies the language model to be used for execution, including model details and API keys, enabling the node to configure and utilize the model appropriately. Type should be `LLM_MODEL`.
        - `query` (Required): The user's input or question that initiates the execution process, serving as the starting point for the interaction with the agent. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `documents_or_string` (Optional): Optional context provided as either a list of documents or a single string, which is used to enrich the agent's understanding and response generation. Type should be `*`.
        - `summary_method` (Optional): Defines the method used to summarize the interaction or content, influencing how the agent processes and presents information. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `max_turns` (Optional): Limits the number of interaction turns between the user and the agent, controlling the depth of the conversation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `clear_history` (Optional): Determines whether to reset the agent's memory before starting the execution, affecting the continuity of context. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Outputs:
        - `file_path`: The path to the generated file as a result of the execution process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `chat_history`: A record of the chat history between the user and the agent throughout the execution. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `summary`: A summary of the interaction or content generated by the agent, based on the specified summarization method. Type should be `STRING`.
