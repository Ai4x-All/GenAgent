- `ConvertAgentToLlamaindex`: This node is designed to transform an agent into a format compatible with Llama, potentially incorporating an optional embedding model to enhance the agent's capabilities.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `agent`: The primary agent to be converted into a Llama-compatible format, serving as the core element for transformation. Type should be `AGENT`.
        - `optional_embed_model`: An optional embedding model that can be included to augment the agent's conversion process, providing additional capabilities or optimizations. Type should be `LLM_EMBED_MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The transformed agent, now in a format compatible with Llama, optionally enhanced by an embedding model. Type should be `LLM_MODEL`.
