- `Robust Video Matting`: The Robust Video Matting node is designed to perform high-quality video matting, separating foreground elements from the background in video frames. It utilizes advanced deep learning models to achieve precise segmentation, even in challenging conditions, and supports dynamic background substitution.
    - Parameters:
        - `backbone`: Specifies the backbone model architecture to be used for video matting, with options including 'mobilenetv3' and 'resnet50'. This choice affects the accuracy and performance of the matting process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `fp16`: A flag indicating whether to use half-precision floating-point (FP16) for computations, potentially improving performance on compatible hardware. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `bg_color`: The background color to apply when separating the foreground from the original background, specified as a string. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `batch_size`: The number of frames to process in a single batch, affecting memory usage and processing speed. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `video_frames`: The sequence of video frames to be processed for matting. This is the primary input that the node operates on, determining the foreground and background elements. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The processed video frames with the background replaced or removed, showcasing the foreground elements. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: A binary mask indicating the presence of foreground elements in each frame, useful for further processing or analysis. Type should be `MASK`.
