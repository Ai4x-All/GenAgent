- `ImageApplyLUT+`: The ImageApplyLUT+ node applies a Look-Up Table (LUT) to an image or a batch of images to adjust their colors, optionally applying color space transformations and blending the original images with their LUT-applied versions based on a specified strength. This process can enhance or stylize images by altering their color profiles.
    - Parameters:
        - `lut_file`: The filename of the Look-Up Table (LUT) to be applied. This determines the specific color transformation that will be executed on the input images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `log_colorspace`: A boolean flag indicating whether to apply a logarithmic color space transformation to the images before and after applying the LUT, enhancing the effect of the LUT under certain conditions. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `clip_values`: A boolean flag that specifies whether to clip the color values of the images to fit within the LUT's domain, ensuring that the output colors are valid within the specified color space. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `strength`: A floating-point value that determines the blend strength between the original images and their LUT-applied versions, allowing for subtle to significant alterations in the image's appearance. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The image or batch of images to which the LUT will be applied. This input is crucial for defining the visual content that will undergo color transformation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The transformed images after applying the LUT, optional color space transformation, and blending based on the specified strength. This output showcases the final stylized or color-corrected images. Type should be `IMAGE`.
