- `ADE_ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine`: This node specializes in the advanced manipulation of conditioning data for generative models, specifically focusing on the application and combination of masks and additional conditioning layers. It enables the enhancement or modification of existing conditioning through the application of masks, strength adjustments, and the integration of new conditioning data, thereby allowing for more precise control over the generative process.
    - Parameters:
        - `strength`: A scalar value that determines the intensity of the mask application on the conditioning. It controls how strongly the additional conditioning and masks affect the original data. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `set_cond_area`: Specifies the area within the conditioning data where modifications are targeted, without mentioning a specific type. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `cond`: The original conditioning data to be enhanced or modified. It serves as the base upon which additional conditioning layers and masks are applied, directly influencing the final output. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `cond_ADD`: Additional conditioning data to be combined with the original conditioning. This layer is applied on top of the existing conditioning, allowing for the introduction of new features or modifications. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `opt_mask`: An optional mask that can be applied to the conditioning data. It allows for selective enhancement or modification of specific areas within the conditioning. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `opt_lora_hook`: An optional LoraHookGroup that can be applied for further manipulation of the conditioning data. It provides additional flexibility in modifying the conditioning. Type should be `LORA_HOOK`.
        - `opt_timesteps`: Optional timesteps for conditional manipulation. This parameter allows for the application of modifications at specific points in the generative process. Type should be `TIMESTEPS_COND`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: The enhanced or modified conditioning data, resulting from the application of additional conditioning layers, masks, and adjustments. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
