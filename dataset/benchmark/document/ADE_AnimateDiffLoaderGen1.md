- `ADE_AnimateDiffLoaderGen1`: The ADE_AnimateDiffLoaderGen1 node is designed to load and initialize the first generation of AnimateDiff models, setting the stage for subsequent animation or image manipulation tasks. It encapsulates the complexities of model loading and configuration, providing a streamlined interface for the generation of dynamic content.
    - Inputs:
        - `model` (Required): This input specifies the AnimateDiff model to be loaded, central to initializing the animation or image manipulation process. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `model_name` (Required): The model_name parameter allows for the selection of a specific AnimateDiff model by name, facilitating a more targeted initialization. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `beta_schedule` (Required): The beta_schedule parameter determines the scheduling of beta values used in the diffusion process, impacting the quality and characteristics of the generated content. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `context_options` (Optional): Optional settings that provide additional context or preferences for the model loading process, allowing for customized initialization. Type should be `CONTEXT_OPTIONS`.
        - `motion_lora` (Optional): Specifies the LoRA parameters for motion models, enabling fine-tuned control over the animation dynamics. Type should be `MOTION_LORA`.
        - `ad_settings` (Optional): Animation and diffusion settings that customize the behavior of the AnimateDiff model during the loading process. Type should be `AD_SETTINGS`.
        - `ad_keyframes` (Optional): Defines keyframes for animation, guiding the model in generating dynamic content over specified intervals. Type should be `AD_KEYFRAMES`.
        - `sample_settings` (Optional): Settings that influence the sampling process, such as temperature and top-k filtering, to refine the generated output. Type should be `SAMPLE_SETTINGS`.
        - `scale_multival` (Optional): Multipliers for scaling the effects in the generated content, allowing for varied intensities of certain features. Type should be `MULTIVAL`.
        - `effect_multival` (Optional): Multipliers for adjusting the intensity of specific effects within the generated content, providing creative control over the output. Type should be `MULTIVAL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: This output is the loaded AnimateDiff model, ready for use in animation or image manipulation tasks. Type should be `MODEL`.
