- `BNK_GetSigma`: The `BNK_GetSigma` node is designed to calculate a specific sigma value based on the provided model, sampler name, scheduler, and step parameters. It focuses on determining the noise level for a given step in the sampling process, adjusting the noise level according to the model's latent space scale factor.
    - Parameters:
        - `sampler_name`: The sampler_name parameter identifies the specific sampling strategy to be used. It influences the calculation of sigma by determining the noise distribution and progression over steps. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: The scheduler parameter defines the scheduling strategy for noise level adjustment over the sampling steps. It plays a key role in how the sigma value is calculated, affecting the noise transition. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `steps`: The steps parameter indicates the total number of steps in the sampling process. It sets the upper limit for the start and end step parameters, affecting the range of sigma calculation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_at_step`: This parameter specifies the starting step for sigma calculation, allowing for the adjustment of the noise level from a specific point in the sampling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_at_step`: The end_at_step parameter determines the ending step for sigma calculation, marking the point up to which the noise level is adjusted. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model parameter specifies the generative model for which the sigma value is being calculated. It is crucial for determining the appropriate noise level in the context of the model's latent space. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `float`: This output represents the calculated sigma value, adjusted for the model's latent space scale factor, indicating the noise level at a specific step in the sampling process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
