- `Image Compare (mtb)`: This node compares two images using different modes such as checkerboard, diff, or blend, and returns a difference image that highlights the variations between them.
    - Parameters:
        - `mode`: Specifies the method of comparison (checkerboard, diff, blend) to apply, influencing how the differences between the images are visualized. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `imageA`: The first image to compare. It plays a crucial role in the comparison process as one of the two images being analyzed for differences. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `imageB`: The second image to compare. It is essential for the comparison process, serving as the counterpart to the first image in identifying differences. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting image after comparison, highlighting differences based on the selected mode. Type should be `IMAGE`.
