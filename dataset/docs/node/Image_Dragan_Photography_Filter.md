- `Image Dragan Photography Filter`: This node applies a Dragan effect to images, enhancing their visual appeal by adjusting saturation, contrast, sharpness, brightness, and colorization. It utilizes a high-pass filter to accentuate details and texture, creating a distinctive, dramatic look.
    - Parameters:
        - `saturation`: Controls the intensity of the image's colors, affecting the vibrancy of the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `contrast`: Adjusts the difference between the darkest and lightest tones in the image, enhancing the visual depth. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `brightness`: Modifies the overall lightness or darkness of the image, affecting its visibility and mood. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sharpness`: Determines the clarity of detail in the image, making textures more pronounced. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `highpass_radius`: Specifies the radius for the high-pass filter, influencing the level of detail enhancement. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `highpass_samples`: Defines the number of samples for the high-pass filter, affecting the texture's granularity. Type should be `INT`.
        - `highpass_strength`: Sets the strength of the high-pass filter, determining the intensity of detail accentuation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `colorize`: Enables or disables colorization, adding a unique hue to the image or preserving its original colors. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input images to which the Dragan effect will be applied. This parameter is crucial for defining the visual content that will undergo transformation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The transformed images with the applied Dragan effect, showcasing enhanced textures and dramatic visual appeal. Type should be `IMAGE`.
