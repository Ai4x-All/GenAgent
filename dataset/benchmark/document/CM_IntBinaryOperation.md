- `CM_IntBinaryOperation`: The node `CM_IntBinaryOperation` performs binary operations on integer inputs, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, based on a specified operation. It abstracts the complexity of these operations into a simple interface, allowing for the dynamic execution of various mathematical operations on integers.
    - Inputs:
        - `op` (Required): Specifies the binary operation to be performed on the integer inputs. This affects the node's execution by determining the mathematical operation applied. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `a` (Required): Represents the first integer input for the binary operation. It is one of the operands on which the specified operation is performed. Type should be `INT`.
        - `b` (Required): Represents the second integer input for the binary operation. It serves as the other operand in the operation alongside `a`. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `int`: The result of the specified binary operation performed on the integer inputs `a` and `b`. Type should be `INT`.
