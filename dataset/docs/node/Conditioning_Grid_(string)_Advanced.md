- `Conditioning Grid (string) Advanced`: This node enhances the functionality of ConditioningGridCond by incorporating an advanced text encoding step for each text input using AdvancedCLIPTextEncode. It automates the process of generating conditioning from text inputs, which are then utilized as inputs for the grid's AreaConditioners, streamlining the creation of complex conditioning grids.
    - Parameters:
        - `base`: The base text input that serves as the foundational conditioning layer for the grid. It is encoded and integrated into the grid's overall conditioning. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `columns`: Specifies the number of columns in the grid. It determines the grid's horizontal dimension and affects how the conditioning is distributed. Type should be `INT`.
        - `rows`: Specifies the number of rows in the grid. It determines the grid's vertical dimension and affects how the conditioning is distributed. Type should be `INT`.
        - `width`: The width of each grid cell. It influences the spatial resolution of the conditioning applied to each cell. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The height of each grid cell. It influences the spatial resolution of the conditioning applied to each cell. Type should be `INT`.
        - `strength`: Determines the intensity of the conditioning applied. It affects how strongly the conditioning influences the generated content. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `token_normalization`: Specifies the method for normalizing the tokens in the text inputs, affecting the encoding process and the resulting conditioning. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `weight_interpretation`: Defines how the weights are interpreted during the encoding process, influencing the conditioning's impact on the generated content. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip`: The CLIP model used for encoding the text inputs. It plays a crucial role in determining the quality and relevance of the generated conditioning. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: The output is a complex conditioning grid, constructed from the encoded text inputs, ready to be used for generating content. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
