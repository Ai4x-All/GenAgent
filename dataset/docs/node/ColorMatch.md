    - Parameters:
        - `method`: Specifies the color transfer method to be used, such as MKL or histogram matching, affecting the style of color adaptation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image_ref`: The reference image whose color palette is to be transferred. It plays a crucial role in determining the final appearance of the target image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_target`: The target image that will receive the color palette of the reference image. This image is transformed to match the color scheme of the reference image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting image after color transfer, with its colors adapted to match the reference image's palette. Type should be `IMAGE`.
