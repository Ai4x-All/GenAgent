- `InstantID Pose Prepare Settings (JPS)`: This node is designed to configure settings for preparing images for Instant ID Pose processing. It allows users to specify various parameters related to image preparation, such as resizing, cropping, padding, and more, to ensure images are optimally prepared for pose detection and analysis.
    - Parameters:
        - `resize_to`: Determines how the image should be resized, with options like 'Keep Size', 'Resize to Target', and 'Resize to Source', affecting the final dimensions of the prepared image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `offset_width`: Specifies the horizontal offset to apply to the image, adjusting its position. Type should be `INT`.
        - `offset_height`: Specifies the vertical offset to apply to the image, adjusting its position. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_left`: Defines the amount to crop from the left side of the image, adjusting its visible area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_right`: Defines the amount to crop from the right side of the image, adjusting its visible area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_top`: Defines the amount to crop from the top of the image, adjusting its visible area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_bottom`: Defines the amount to crop from the bottom of the image, adjusting its visible area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `padding_left`: Specifies the amount of padding to add to the left side of the image, expanding its border. Type should be `INT`.
        - `padding_right`: Specifies the amount of padding to add to the right side of the image, expanding its border. Type should be `INT`.
        - `padding_top`: Specifies the amount of padding to add to the top of the image, expanding its border. Type should be `INT`.
        - `padding_bottom`: Specifies the amount of padding to add to the bottom of the image, expanding its border. Type should be `INT`.
        - `interpolation`: Determines the method used for resizing or transforming the image, such as 'nearest', 'bilinear', etc. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `sharpening`: Specifies the intensity of the sharpening effect applied to the image, enhancing its details. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `flip`: Indicates whether the image should be flipped horizontally, vertically, or not at all, affecting its orientation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `imageprepare_settings`: The tuple containing all the specified settings for image preparation, ready to be applied for pose processing. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
