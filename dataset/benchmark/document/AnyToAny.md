- `AnyToAny`: The AnyToAny node is designed to dynamically evaluate a user-defined function on its input, allowing for a wide range of operations from simple transformations to complex computations. This flexibility enables users to apply arbitrary logic to their data, making it a versatile tool for custom data manipulation and analysis.
    - Inputs:
        - `v` (Required): Represents the input value on which the user-defined function will be applied. Its flexibility allows for any type of data to be processed, making the node adaptable to various use cases. Type should be `*`.
        - `function` (Required): A string representing a user-defined function to be evaluated on the input. This function is defined in a lambda expression format, enabling dynamic and complex operations on the input data. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `*`: The output type is dynamic, determined by the result of the user-defined function applied to the input. This allows for a wide range of possible output types, reflecting the node's versatility. Type should be `*`.
