- `ImpactMakeTileSEGS`: The ImpactMakeTileSEGS node is designed for segmenting images into tiles based on specified bounding box sizes and overlap criteria. It applies various filters to include or exclude specific segments, adjusts tile sizes and overlaps to accommodate irregular masks, and ensures that the segmentation respects the image's dimensions and the specified constraints. This node is particularly useful in scenarios where image analysis or processing needs to be localized to smaller, manageable regions within larger images.
    - Inputs:
        - `images` (Required): Specifies the images to be segmented into tiles. This is the primary input that the node operates on, determining the scope of the segmentation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `bbox_size` (Required): Specifies the size of the bounding box for each tile. It determines how large each segmented tile will be, directly affecting the granularity of the segmentation process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_factor` (Required): Determines the factor by which the bounding box is enlarged or reduced, affecting the size of the segmented tiles. This parameter is crucial for adjusting the coverage area of each tile, ensuring that the segmentation process can be tailored to specific analysis needs or to accommodate varying image sizes. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `min_overlap` (Required): Defines the minimum overlap between adjacent tiles. This parameter ensures that important features are not missed at the boundaries of tiles by providing a buffer zone where tiles overlap. Type should be `INT`.
        - `filter_segs_dilation` (Required): Specifies the dilation applied to the segments before filtering. This can alter the inclusion or exclusion of segments based on their expanded boundaries, directly influencing the segmentation outcome by modifying how segments are considered for tiling. Type should be `INT`.
        - `mask_irregularity` (Required): Specifies the degree of irregularity allowed for masks within the tiles. This parameter helps in fine-tuning the segmentation process to either include or exclude tiles based on the irregularity of their masks, affecting the overall quality and relevance of the segmented tiles. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `irregular_mask_mode` (Required): Determines the mode of handling irregular masks, such as ignoring, including, or exclusively focusing on irregularly shaped segments. This affects the node's execution by guiding the segmentation process to prioritize or deprioritize certain types of segments based on their shape. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `filter_in_segs_opt` (Optional): Provides options for including specific segments based on predefined criteria. This influences the node's execution by allowing for the customization of the segmentation process to target or highlight particular features or areas within the images. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `filter_out_segs_opt` (Optional): Provides options for excluding specific segments based on predefined criteria. This parameter plays a critical role in refining the output by removing unwanted segments, thereby enhancing the focus and relevance of the segmented tiles. Type should be `SEGS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `segs`: Outputs the segmented tiles along with their corresponding segments, facilitating further processing or analysis. This output is crucial for downstream tasks that require segmented image data. Type should be `SEGS`.
