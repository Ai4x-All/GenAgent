- `BatchUncropAdvanced`: The `BatchUncropAdvanced` node is designed for the advanced uncropping of images in a batch process. It combines original images with their cropped versions, applying sophisticated techniques such as border blending, rescaling, and optional use of combined or square masks to achieve seamless integration of cropped areas back into the original images.
    - Parameters:
        - `border_blending`: The degree to which the borders of the cropped images are blended with the original images. This parameter is key to achieving a natural-looking integration of the cropped areas. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `crop_rescale`: Indicates whether the cropped images should be rescaled to their original size before being uncropped. This is important for maintaining the original aspect ratio and size of the image content. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `use_combined_mask`: Determines whether the combined crop mask is used for the uncropping process. This option allows for more complex uncropping scenarios where a single mask is preferable. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `use_square_mask`: Specifies if a square mask should be used instead of the actual crop shapes. This can simplify the uncropping process in certain scenarios. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `original_images`: The collection of original images that were previously cropped. These images serve as the base for the uncropping process, ensuring that the cropped content is accurately integrated back into its original context. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `cropped_images`: The set of images that have been cropped from the original images. These images are to be uncropped and merged back into the original images, utilizing advanced techniques for seamless integration. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `cropped_masks`: Masks indicating the regions of the original images that were cropped. These masks are crucial for accurately aligning the cropped images back into their original positions. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `combined_crop_mask`: A single mask that combines all individual cropped masks. This is used for advanced uncropping scenarios where a unified approach to mask application is beneficial. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `bboxes`: Bounding boxes that define the cropped areas within the original images. These are essential for precise placement and scaling of the cropped images during the uncropping process. Type should be `BBOX`.
        - `combined_bounding_box`: An optional parameter that defines a unified bounding box for scenarios where a single, combined area is preferred for uncropping. This allows for more controlled placement and scaling of the uncropped content. Type should be `BBOX`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The original images after the cropped images have been uncropped and integrated back into them. This output reflects the successful merging of cropped content back into its original context. Type should be `IMAGE`.
