- `VHS_VAEEncodeBatched`: The VHS_VAEEncodeBatched node is designed for batch processing of images through a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to produce latent representations. It efficiently handles large sets of images by dividing them into smaller batches, encoding each batch separately, and then merging the results. This node is part of the Video Helper Suite, aimed at facilitating video processing and manipulation tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `per_batch`: The 'per_batch' parameter controls the number of images processed in each batch. It allows for flexible management of memory usage and computational load during the encoding process. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pixels`: The 'pixels' parameter represents the images to be encoded into latent space. It is crucial for the node's operation as it provides the raw data for the VAE to process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `vae`: The 'vae' parameter specifies the Variational Autoencoder model used for encoding the images. It determines the encoding mechanism and the structure of the generated latent space. Type should be `VAE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The output is a latent representation of the input images, encoded by the VAE. It serves as a compressed, feature-rich version of the original data. Type should be `LATENT`.
