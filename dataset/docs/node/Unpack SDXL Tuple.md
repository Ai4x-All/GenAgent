- `Unpack SDXL Tuple`: The 'Unpack SDXL Tuple' node is designed to decompose a complex tuple structure into its constituent components, specifically tailored for handling data related to models, clips, and conditioning elements in an efficient manner. It facilitates the separation and individual handling of base and refiner elements, enhancing modularity and flexibility in processing SDXL tuples.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `sdxl_tuple`: The SDXL tuple to be unpacked, containing combined model, clip, and conditioning information for both base and refiner stages. Type should be `SDXL_TUPLE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `BASE_MODEL`: The base model component extracted from the SDXL tuple. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `BASE_CLIP`: The base clip component extracted from the SDXL tuple. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `BASE_CONDITIONING+`: The positive base conditioning component extracted from the SDXL tuple. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `BASE_CONDITIONING-`: The negative base conditioning component extracted from the SDXL tuple. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `REFINER_MODEL`: The refiner model component extracted from the SDXL tuple. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `REFINER_CLIP`: The refiner clip component extracted from the SDXL tuple. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `REFINER_CONDITIONING+`: The positive refiner conditioning component extracted from the SDXL tuple. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `REFINER_CONDITIONING-`: The negative refiner conditioning component extracted from the SDXL tuple. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
