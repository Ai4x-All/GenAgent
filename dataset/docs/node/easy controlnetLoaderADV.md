- `easy controlnetLoaderADV`: This node specializes in loading advanced control networks, offering enhanced capabilities for fine-tuning and applying control nets to various models. It extends the functionality of standard control net loaders by supporting additional parameters and configurations, enabling more precise control and customization of the control net's application.
    - Parameters:
        - `control_net_name`: Specifies the name of the control net to be loaded. This parameter is crucial as it determines which control net is utilized for the operation, affecting the outcome significantly. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `strength`: Defines the intensity of the control net's effect, allowing for dynamic adjustment of its impact on the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_percent`: Specifies the starting percentage of the effect, enabling phased application of the control net over the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_percent`: Determines the ending percentage of the effect, facilitating a gradual application of the control net's influence. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `scale_soft_weights`: Adjusts the softness of the weights applied by the control net, allowing for finer control over its influence. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Represents the pipeline context in which the control net is applied, affecting how the control net integrates with other components. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `image`: The image to which the control net will be applied, serving as the target for control net adjustments. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `control_net`: The control net object to be applied, allowing for the customization and application of specific control net configurations. Type should be `CONTROL_NET`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The updated pipeline after applying the control net, reflecting changes and adjustments made. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `positive`: The positive conditioning effect produced by the control net, enhancing certain aspects of the image. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: The negative conditioning effect produced by the control net, diminishing certain aspects of the image. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
