- `Mikey Sampler`: The Mikey Sampler node is designed for sampling operations within the Mikey framework, focusing on generating or manipulating data samples. It abstracts complex sampling processes, providing a streamlined interface for various sampling techniques.
    - Inputs:
        - `base_model` (Required): The 'base_model' parameter specifies the primary model used for sampling, serving as the foundation for generating or refining samples. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `refiner_model` (Required): The 'refiner_model' parameter specifies an additional model used to refine the samples generated by the base model, enhancing their quality or characteristics. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `samples` (Required): The 'samples' parameter represents the initial data samples that are to be processed or generated by the sampling operation. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `vae` (Required): The 'vae' parameter specifies the variational autoencoder used in the sampling process, often for encoding or decoding operations. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `positive_cond_base` (Required): The 'positive_cond_base' parameter defines the positive conditioning applied to the base model, guiding the sampling towards desired characteristics. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative_cond_base` (Required): The 'negative_cond_base' parameter defines the negative conditioning applied to the base model, steering the sampling away from undesired characteristics. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `positive_cond_refiner` (Required): The 'positive_cond_refiner' parameter defines the positive conditioning applied to the refiner model, enhancing the refinement process towards desired outcomes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative_cond_refiner` (Required): The 'negative_cond_refiner' parameter defines the negative conditioning applied to the refiner model, preventing the refinement from incorporating undesired features. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `model_name` (Required): The 'model_name' parameter specifies the name of the model being used, which can influence the sampling process by selecting specific model configurations or versions. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed` (Required): The 'seed' parameter ensures reproducibility of the sampling results by initializing the random number generator used in the sampling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `upscale_by` (Required): The 'upscale_by' parameter determines the factor by which the samples are upscaled, affecting the resolution or size of the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `hires_strength` (Required): The 'hires_strength' parameter adjusts the strength of high-resolution features in the samples, allowing for finer control over the detail level in the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The output is a latent representation of the sampled data, which can be further processed or used for generating final outputs. Type should be `LATENT`.
