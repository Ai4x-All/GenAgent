- `Image to Noise`: This node transforms an input image into a noise pattern, incorporating various adjustments to simulate different noise effects. It leverages parameters such as color quantization, brightness modification, and optional gaussian blurring to produce a customized noise visualization. The node facilitates the creation of noise-based visual effects or textures from images, offering a range of customization options to achieve the desired noise pattern.
    - Parameters:
        - `num_colors`: Specifies the number of colors to quantize the input image to, affecting the color depth of the noise pattern. Type should be `INT`.
        - `black_mix`: Determines the intensity of black pixels mixed into the noise pattern, influencing the pattern's darkness. Type should be `INT`.
        - `gaussian_mix`: Controls the level of Gaussian blur applied to the noise pattern, affecting its softness. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `brightness`: Adjusts the brightness of the noise pattern, modifying its overall lightness. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `output_mode`: Specifies the format of the output, either as a batch of images or a list, affecting the structure of the returned noise patterns. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed`: Sets the seed for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the noise pattern. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: Represents the collection of input images to be transformed into noise patterns, serving as the foundation for the noise effect application. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output image transformed into a noise pattern, showcasing the applied noise effect. Type should be `IMAGE`.
