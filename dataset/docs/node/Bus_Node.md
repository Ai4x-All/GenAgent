- `Bus Node`: The 'Bus Node' serves as a central hub for routing and overriding various components such as models, CLIP, VAE, and conditioning inputs within a generative AI pipeline. It facilitates the dynamic interchange and management of these components, ensuring that the most appropriate resources are utilized for each operation.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `bus`: A tuple containing references to a model, CLIP, VAE, positive conditioning, and negative conditioning. It acts as a conduit for passing these components through the pipeline, allowing for their dynamic interchange and management. Type should be `BUS`.
        - `model`: A specific model to be used in the operation. If provided, it overrides the model component of the bus. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: A specific CLIP model to be used in the operation. If provided, it overrides the CLIP component of the bus. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `vae`: A specific VAE model to be used in the operation. If provided, it overrides the VAE component of the bus. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `positive`: Positive conditioning to influence the generation towards desired attributes. If provided, it overrides the positive conditioning component of the bus. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Negative conditioning to influence the generation away from undesired attributes. If provided, it overrides the negative conditioning component of the bus. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `bus`: A tuple representing the updated state of the bus, containing the current set of components (model, CLIP, VAE, positive conditioning, negative conditioning) after any overrides. Type should be `BUS`.
        - `model`: The model component currently in use, either passed directly or derived from the bus. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The CLIP model component currently in use, either passed directly or derived from the bus. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `vae`: The VAE model component currently in use, either passed directly or derived from the bus. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `positive`: The positive conditioning component currently in use, either passed directly or derived from the bus. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: The negative conditioning component currently in use, either passed directly or derived from the bus. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
