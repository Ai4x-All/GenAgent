- `SaltScheduledImageDisplacement`: This node applies a scheduled displacement to a batch of images based on provided amplitude and angle schedules, utilizing an optimized displacement layer for image transformation. It allows for dynamic image manipulation over a sequence, adapting the displacement effect according to predefined schedules.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The batch of images to be displaced. This input is crucial for defining the base content that will undergo displacement. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `displacement_images`: Images used to determine the displacement direction and magnitude for each image in the batch. These images play a key role in guiding the displacement process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `amplitude_schedule`: A schedule specifying the amplitude of displacement for each image in the batch. It controls the intensity of the displacement effect. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `angle_schedule`: A schedule detailing the angle of displacement for each image. This parameter dictates the direction of the displacement effect. Type should be `LIST`.
    - Outputs:
        - `images`: The batch of images after applying the scheduled displacement. This output showcases the transformed images with the displacement effects applied. Type should be `IMAGE`.
