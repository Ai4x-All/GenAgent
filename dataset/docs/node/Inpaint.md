- `Inpaint`: The Inpaint node is designed to reconstruct missing or damaged parts of images by utilizing a specified inpainting technique. It leverages a mask to identify the areas to be inpainted and applies a chosen algorithm to fill in these regions seamlessly, enhancing the overall image quality.
    - Parameters:
        - `radius`: The 'radius' parameter determines the neighborhood size around each point for inpainting, affecting the smoothness and extent of the inpainting effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `flag`: The 'flag' parameter allows selection of the inpainting algorithm to be used, offering flexibility in choosing the method best suited for the image's specific needs. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `img`: The 'img' parameter represents the image to be inpainted. It is crucial as it provides the visual data on which the inpainting operation is performed. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: The 'mask' parameter specifies the areas within the image that require inpainting. It plays a key role in guiding the inpainting process to the intended regions. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is the inpainted image, where the specified areas have been reconstructed using the chosen inpainting technique. Type should be `IMAGE`.
