- `KSamplerVariationsStochastic+`: This node is designed to introduce stochastic variations into the sampling process, leveraging randomness to enhance the diversity and quality of generated samples. It focuses on applying stochastic methods to modify or influence the sampling behavior, aiming to produce varied outcomes that might not be achievable through deterministic approaches alone.
    - Parameters:
        - `noise_seed`: Sets the seed for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the stochastic variations introduced during the sampling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Defines the number of steps to be taken in the sampling process, affecting the depth and detail of the exploration within the sample space. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Controls the conditioning free guidance scale, influencing the direction and intensity of the sampling process towards desired outcomes. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler`: Determines the specific stochastic sampling method to be applied, directly impacting the nature of variations introduced. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Selects the scheduling strategy for the sampling process, which can affect the progression and adaptation of sampling parameters over time. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `variation_strength`: Determines the strength of the variations introduced, affecting the degree of change and diversity in the sampling outcomes. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `cfg_scale`: Adjusts the scale of the conditioning free guidance, further influencing the sampling process and its alignment with desired outcomes. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: Specifies the model to be used for the sampling process, playing a crucial role in determining the characteristics and quality of the generated samples. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `latent_image`: Introduces a latent image as the starting point for the sampling process, serving as a foundation for the stochastic variations to build upon. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `positive`: Provides positive conditioning to guide the sampling process towards favorable outcomes, enhancing the relevance and quality of generated samples. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Supplies negative conditioning to steer the sampling away from undesirable outcomes, refining the focus and quality of the samples produced. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `variation_seed`: Introduces an additional seed to control the variation in the sampling process, offering another layer of stochastic influence. Type should be `INT:seed`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: Produces a modified latent representation, enriched with stochastic variations through the sampling process. Type should be `LATENT`.
