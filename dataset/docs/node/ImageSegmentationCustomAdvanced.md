- `ImageSegmentationCustomAdvanced`: The ImageSegmentationCustomAdvanced node is designed for advanced image segmentation tasks, offering customizable options for processing images with specific models and settings. It enables fine-tuning of segmentation parameters and post-processing techniques to achieve precise and tailored segmentation results.
    - Parameters:
        - `model`: The segmentation model to be used. This choice affects the accuracy and type of segmentation performed, allowing for flexibility in addressing various segmentation challenges. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `alpha_matting`: A boolean flag indicating whether alpha matting should be applied to refine the segmentation edges. This enhances the quality of the segmentation by providing smoother and more natural edges. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `alpha_matting_foreground_threshold`: The threshold value for determining foreground pixels in alpha matting. This parameter helps in fine-tuning the edge refinement process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha_matting_background_threshold`: The threshold value for determining background pixels in alpha matting. It plays a key role in accurately separating the background from the foreground. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha_matting_erode_size`: The size of the erosion applied during alpha matting. This affects the detail level of the segmentation edges, allowing for more precise edge control. Type should be `INT`.
        - `post_process_mask`: A boolean flag indicating whether the segmentation mask should undergo post-processing. This can include operations like smoothing or filtering to improve the mask's quality. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
