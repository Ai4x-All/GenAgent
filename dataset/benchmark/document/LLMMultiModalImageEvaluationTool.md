- `LLMMultiModalImageEvaluationTool`: This node specializes in evaluating images based on specific queries using a language model. It processes image paths or documents, loads the images, and sends them to the language model along with the query for comprehensive evaluation. The node is designed to integrate multimodal inputs (text and images) for generating detailed assessments or responses, making it a critical component for applications requiring nuanced understanding and interaction with visual content.
    - Inputs:
        - `llm_model` (Required): The language model used for evaluating the images in conjunction with the provided query. It's essential for interpreting the visual content and generating relevant responses. Type should be `LLM_MODEL`.
        - `name` (Required): A unique identifier for the evaluation tool. This parameter is crucial for distinguishing between different instances or uses of the evaluation tool. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `description` (Required): A detailed description of the evaluation tool's purpose and functionality. This parameter helps to provide context and expectations for the tool's output. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `image_documents` (Optional): A list of image documents to be evaluated. This parameter enables the node to directly process pre-loaded images for evaluation, facilitating more flexible and efficient handling of visual content. Type should be `DOCUMENT`.
        - `max_tokens` (Optional): The maximum number of tokens to be generated by the language model in the response. It controls the verbosity and detail level of the evaluation output. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `evaluator_tool`: The output from the node providing an evaluation or response based on the input query and images. It represents the node's capability to assess and interpret visual content through the language model. Type should be `TOOL`.
