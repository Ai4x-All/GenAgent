- `KSamplerAdvancedProvider`: This node provides an advanced KSampler configuration, enabling the customization of sampling processes with additional parameters and options for more complex and tailored sampling strategies.
    - Parameters:
        - `cfg`: Specifies the configuration value for the sampler, influencing its behavior and performance characteristics. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Determines the specific sampler to be used, chosen from a predefined set of samplers. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Selects the scheduling algorithm to manage the sampling process, affecting the progression and adjustment of sampling parameters. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `sigma_factor`: Adjusts the sigma factor, modifying the noise level applied during the sampling process for fine-tuning purposes. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `basic_pipe`: Provides the basic pipeline components necessary for the sampling operation, including the model and conditioning information. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
        - `sampler_opt`: Optional sampler configurations, allowing for further customization of the sampling process. Type should be `SAMPLER`.
    - Outputs:
        - `ksampler_advanced`: An advanced KSampler instance configured with the specified parameters for complex sampling tasks. Type should be `KSAMPLER_ADVANCED`.
