- `SaltAIStableVideoDiffusion`: The SaltAIStableVideoDiffusion node is designed to interface with Stability AI's API to generate video content based on a given image. It utilizes advanced diffusion techniques to produce high-quality video animations, transforming static images into dynamic video sequences through a series of API calls and image processing steps.
    - Parameters:
        - `api_key`: The API key required to authenticate requests to the Stability AI API. It is essential for accessing the video generation capabilities of the API. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `seed`: A seed value to ensure reproducibility of the video generation process. It influences the randomness of the video's visual evolution. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: The CFG scale parameter controls the creativity of the video generation. A higher value encourages more novel video content. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `mbi`: The motion bucket ID parameter influences the motion dynamics within the generated video, affecting how the image animates over time. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be transformed into a video sequence. It plays a crucial role in determining the visual content of the generated video. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `frames`: A batch of video frames as a tensor, representing the generated video sequence. Each frame is a transformation of the input image, collectively forming a coherent video. Type should be `IMAGE`.
