- `SDTurboScheduler`: SDTurboScheduler is designed to generate a sequence of sigma values for image sampling, adjusting the sequence based on the denoise level and the number of steps specified. It leverages a specific model's sampling capabilities to produce these sigma values, which are crucial for controlling the denoising process during image generation.
    - Parameters:
        - `steps`: The steps parameter determines the length of the sigma sequence to be generated, directly influencing the granularity of the denoising process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `denoise`: The denoise parameter adjusts the starting point of the sigma sequence, allowing for finer control over the denoising level applied during image generation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model parameter specifies the generative model to be used for sigma value generation. It is crucial for determining the specific sampling behavior and capabilities of the scheduler. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `sigmas`: A sequence of sigma values generated based on the specified model, steps, and denoise level. These values are essential for controlling the denoising process in image generation. Type should be `SIGMAS`.
