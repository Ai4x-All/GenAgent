- `ReActorMaskHelper`: The ReActorMaskHelper node is designed to assist in the process of masking within the ReActor framework. It likely involves operations such as combining, dilating, and possibly refining masks to be used in face swapping or restoration tasks, leveraging specific detection hints and mask manipulation techniques to optimize the masking process for better results.
    - Parameters:
        - `bbox_model_name`: Specifies the name of the model used for bounding box detection, influencing the initial step of mask generation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `bbox_threshold`: The threshold value for bounding box detection, determining the sensitivity of the model in identifying potential areas of interest. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `bbox_dilation`: Indicates the dilation factor applied to bounding boxes, potentially expanding the area considered for mask application. Type should be `INT`.
        - `bbox_crop_factor`: Defines how much to crop around the detected bounding box, affecting the final mask's coverage area. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `bbox_drop_size`: The minimum size for bounding boxes to be considered, filtering out detections that are too small. Type should be `INT`.
        - `sam_model_name`: The name of the model used for SAM (Semantic Attention Mask) prediction, crucial for refining mask details. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `sam_dilation`: Dilation factor specifically for SAM predictions, adjusting the mask's boundary for better fit or coverage. Type should be `INT`.
        - `sam_threshold`: Threshold for SAM predictions, determining which masks are included based on confidence scores. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `bbox_expansion`: Specifies how much to expand the bounding box beyond its detected borders, affecting the area covered by the mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `mask_hint_threshold`: Threshold for generating mask hints, used in processes that require pre-identification of mask areas. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `mask_hint_use_negative`: Indicates whether to use negative hints (areas not to mask) in the mask generation process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `morphology_operation`: Specifies the type of morphological operation (e.g., dilate, erode) to apply to the mask, affecting its shape and boundaries. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `morphology_distance`: The distance parameter for the morphological operation, determining the extent of the transformation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blur_radius`: Radius for blurring the mask, used to soften edges or blend the mask more seamlessly with the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `sigma_factor`: Factor for calculating the sigma value in Gaussian blur, affecting the smoothness of the mask's edges. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The 'image' parameter is the primary input for mask-related operations, serving as the base for detection, manipulation, and transformation processes. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `swapped_image`: This parameter represents the image resulting from a face swap operation, which may require further masking or adjustments. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask_optional`: An optional mask input that can be used for additional mask operations or adjustments. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `IMAGE`: The processed image with applied mask modifications, ready for further use or display. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `MASK`: The final mask generated or modified by the node, suitable for masking or compositing operations. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `MASK_PREVIEW`: A preview of the mask, typically used for visualization or debugging purposes. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `SWAPPED_FACE`: The image resulting from a face swap operation, potentially including mask adjustments for improved integration. Type should be `IMAGE`.
