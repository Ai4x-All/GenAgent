- `FromBasicPipe`: The FromBasicPipe node is designed to decompose a basic pipe structure into its constituent components, facilitating access to individual elements such as models, clips, and VAEs for further processing or analysis.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `basic_pipe`: Represents the basic pipe structure encapsulating a model, clip, VAE, and positive and negative conditioning elements. It serves as the input for decomposition into its constituent components. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The model component extracted from the basic pipe. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The clip component extracted from the basic pipe. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `vae`: The VAE component extracted from the basic pipe. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `positive`: The positive conditioning element extracted from the basic pipe. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: The negative conditioning element extracted from the basic pipe. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
