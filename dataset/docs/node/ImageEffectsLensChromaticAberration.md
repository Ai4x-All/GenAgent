- `ImageEffectsLensChromaticAberration`: This node applies a chromatic aberration effect to images, simulating the way light disperses through a lens, creating a visually distinctive color-fringing effect. It enhances visual content by adding an artistic or realistic touch of lens imperfection, often used to give images a more dynamic or vintage appearance.
    - Parameters:
        - `shift`: Determines the shift in pixels to simulate the chromatic aberration effect, affecting the displacement of color channels. Type should be `INT`.
        - `method`: Specifies the method used for handling edge pixels during the chromatic aberration effect, ensuring the effect is applied consistently across the image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `shift_type`: Defines the type of shift applied to the chromatic aberration effect, influencing the direction and nature of the color channel displacement. Type should be `INT`.
        - `mixing_type`: Controls how the original and shifted color channels are combined, affecting the overall intensity and appearance of the chromatic aberration effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `transpose`: Determines if and how the image is transposed before applying the chromatic aberration effect, impacting the orientation of the effect. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `colors`: Selects the color channels to be shifted, directly influencing the color composition of the chromatic aberration effect. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lens_curvy`: Adjusts the curvature of the lens effect, modifying how pronounced the chromatic aberration appears across the images. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The input images to which the chromatic aberration effect will be applied. This parameter is crucial for defining the base content that will undergo the transformation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The transformed images with the chromatic aberration effect applied, showcasing the visual enhancement or artistic touch added to the original content. Type should be `IMAGE`.
