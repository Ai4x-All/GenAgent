- `SUPIR_model_loader_v2`: The SUPIR_model_loader_v2 node is designed to initialize and prepare the SUPIR model for use, specifically by loading the model's state from a specified path and optionally adjusting its precision for memory efficiency. This node plays a crucial role in setting up the SUPIR model for subsequent image processing tasks, ensuring that the model is correctly loaded and ready for operation.
    - Parameters:
        - `supir_model`: Specifies the file paths to the SUPIR model checkpoints, which are essential for loading the model's state for use in image processing tasks. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `fp8_unet`: A boolean flag that, when set, converts the model's weights to a lower precision format (torch.float8_e4m3fn) to save VRAM, with a slight impact on quality. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `diffusion_dtype`: Determines the data type for diffusion operations, offering options like fp16, bf16, fp32, or auto for automatic selection based on the execution environment. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `high_vram`: A boolean flag that, when enabled, uses a high VRAM mode for loading model weights, potentially improving model loading speed. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: Specifies the main model configuration for the SUPIR model loader, integrating various components like CLIP and VAE for enhanced image processing. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: Specifies the CLIP model used in conjunction with the SUPIR model to enhance its capabilities, particularly for tasks involving image and text processing. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `vae`: Specifies the VAE model used alongside the SUPIR model, contributing to the overall image processing and generation capabilities. Type should be `VAE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `SUPIR_model`: The loaded SUPIR model, ready for image processing tasks. Type should be `SUPIRMODEL`.
        - `SUPIR_VAE`: The loaded SUPIR VAE component, integral to the model's image processing capabilities. Type should be `SUPIRVAE`.
