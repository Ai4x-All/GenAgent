- `ADE_AnimateDiffLoaderV1Advanced`: This node facilitates the advanced loading of AnimateDiff models, specifically tailored for handling deprecated functionalities and legacy configurations. It abstractly supports the integration and utilization of older AnimateDiff models within current workflows, ensuring compatibility and access to historical model features.
    - Parameters:
        - `model_name`: Identifies the specific name of the AnimateDiff model to be loaded, enabling precise selection of legacy models. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `unlimited_area_hack`: A boolean flag that enables or disables the unlimited area hack, providing a workaround for specific loading scenarios. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `context_length`: Specifies the length of the context to be used during model loading, affecting how the model processes input. Type should be `INT`.
        - `context_stride`: Determines the stride of the context, influencing the model's loading and processing efficiency. Type should be `INT`.
        - `context_overlap`: Defines the overlap between context segments during model loading, optimizing the model's understanding of sequential data. Type should be `INT`.
        - `context_schedule`: Selects the schedule for context application, allowing for flexible adaptation to various loading requirements. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `closed_loop`: A boolean parameter that indicates whether the model loading should operate in a closed loop, affecting the model's initialization process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `beta_schedule`: Chooses the beta schedule to be used during model loading, impacting the model's adaptation and performance. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: Specifies the AnimateDiff model to be loaded, focusing on deprecated models for specific legacy applications. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `latents`: Defines the latent configurations to be applied to the AnimateDiff model during loading, allowing for customization of the model's behavior. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: Outputs the loaded AnimateDiff model, ready for further processing or application. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `latent`: Provides the latent configurations applied during the model loading, reflecting the customization of the model's behavior. Type should be `LATENT`.
