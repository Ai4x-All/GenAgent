- `easy zero123Loader`: The `easy zero123Loader` node is designed to simplify the process of loading and configuring 3D models for generation tasks. It abstracts away the complexities involved in setting up 3D model parameters, making it easier for users to generate 3D content with specific attributes and configurations.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: Specifies the checkpoint name for the model to be loaded, serving as a key identifier for retrieving the correct model configuration. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `vae_name`: Identifies the VAE model to be used in conjunction with the main model, facilitating specific generative tasks. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `empty_latent_width`: Defines the width of the latent space for the 3D model, affecting the resolution and detail of the generated 3D content. Type should be `INT`.
        - `empty_latent_height`: Defines the height of the latent space for the 3D model, affecting the resolution and detail of the generated 3D content. Type should be `INT`.
        - `batch_size`: Determines the number of 3D content pieces to generate in a single batch, allowing for efficient bulk generation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `elevation`: Specifies the elevation angle for the 3D model generation, influencing the vertical orientation of the generated content. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `azimuth`: Specifies the azimuth angle for the 3D model generation, influencing the horizontal orientation of the generated content. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `init_image`: Defines the initial image to be used as a basis for generation, setting a starting point for the model's output. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: Returns the pipeline configuration used for generating the 3D content, encapsulating the sequence of operations performed. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model`: Provides the loaded model after applying the specified configurations, ready for generating 3D content. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `vae`: Returns the VAE model used in the generation process, highlighting its role in shaping the final output. Type should be `VAE`.
