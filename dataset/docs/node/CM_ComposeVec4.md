- `CM_ComposeVec4`: The `CM_ComposeVec4` node is designed for the mathematical conversion of individual float values into a four-dimensional vector (Vec4). This operation is fundamental in various mathematical and graphical computations where a Vec4 representation is required.
    - Parameters:
        - `x`: Represents the first component of the Vec4, influencing its spatial or graphical representation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `y`: Denotes the second component of the Vec4, contributing to its spatial or graphical characteristics. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `z`: Defines the third component of the Vec4, affecting its spatial or graphical attributes. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `w`: Indicates the fourth component of the Vec4, impacting its spatial or graphical representation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `vec4`: Outputs a four-dimensional vector (Vec4) constructed from the input float values. Type should be `VEC4`.
