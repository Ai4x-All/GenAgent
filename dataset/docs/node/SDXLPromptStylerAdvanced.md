- `SDXLPromptStylerAdvanced`: The SDXLPromptStylerAdvanced node is designed to enhance and stylize text prompts for generative models by applying advanced styling techniques. It allows for the customization of positive and negative prompts through a variety of styling options, enabling more nuanced and targeted prompt engineering.
    - Parameters:
        - `text_positive_g`: The global positive text to be styled. It serves as the base content for applying global styling transformations. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_positive_l`: The local positive text to be styled. This text is subject to local styling adjustments, allowing for fine-grained control over the prompt's appearance. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_negative`: The negative text to be styled. It is used to apply styling that contrasts with the positive prompts, aiding in the generation of more balanced and diverse outputs. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `style`: Specifies the styling template to be applied to the prompts. This parameter determines the overall aesthetic and thematic direction of the styled prompts. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `negative_prompt_to`: Controls the application scope of negative styling, allowing users to specify whether the styling should be applied globally, locally, or to both positive and negative prompts. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `copy_to_l`: A boolean flag indicating whether the global styling should also be copied to the local positive text, enabling uniform styling across both global and local prompts. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `log_prompt`: Enables logging of the styling process, including the input texts and the chosen style, facilitating debugging and refinement of the styling effects. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `text_positive_g`: The global positive text after styling. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_positive_l`: The local positive text after styling. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_positive`: The combined positive text after styling. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_negative_g`: The global negative text after styling. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_negative_l`: The local negative text after styling. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_negative`: The combined negative text after styling. Type should be `STRING`.
