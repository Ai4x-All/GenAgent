- `LLMRegexRepair`: The LLMRegexRepair node utilizes a language model to correct and improve regex patterns based on a given description of their intended functionality and any additional directions. It aims to transform potentially malformed or incorrect regex expressions into well-formed patterns that accurately match the specified criteria.
    - Inputs:
        - `llm_model` (Required): Specifies the language model to use for repairing the regex pattern. It is crucial for interpreting the input pattern and generating the corrected version. Type should be `LLM_MODEL`.
        - `text_input` (Required): The potentially malformed or incorrect regex pattern that needs to be repaired. It serves as the primary input for the correction process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `description` (Required): A description of what the regex pattern is intended to match and how the current pattern fails to meet these criteria. This context helps guide the repair process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `extra_directions` (Optional): Additional instructions or constraints to guide the language model in repairing the regex pattern. This can include specific formatting requirements or limitations. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `repaired_regex_pattern`: The corrected regex pattern, as generated by the language model. It reflects the intended functionality described in the input. Type should be `STRING`.
