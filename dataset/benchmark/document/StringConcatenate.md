- `StringConcatenate`: The `StringConcatenate` node is designed to merge multiple pairs of text and frame identifiers into a single string representation. This node is crucial for scenarios requiring the aggregation of textual data associated with specific frames, facilitating the creation of a structured text list that maps frame identifiers to their corresponding text.
    - Inputs:
        - `text_a` (Required): `text_a` is the initial piece of text to be concatenated. Its inclusion is essential for starting the construction of the text list, serving as the foundation upon which additional text-frame pairs can be appended. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `frame_a` (Required): `frame_a` represents the frame identifier associated with `text_a`. It is crucial for mapping `text_a` to a specific frame in the resulting text list, thereby organizing the text in a structured manner. Type should be `INT`.
        - `text_b` (Required): `text_b` is the second piece of text to be concatenated. It is appended to `text_a`, contributing to the expansion of the text list with more text-frame mappings. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `frame_b` (Required): `frame_b` represents the frame identifier associated with `text_b`. Its inclusion further structures the text list by mapping `text_b` to another specific frame. Type should be `INT`.
        - `text_c` (Optional): `text_c` is an optional third piece of text that can be concatenated if provided. It allows for the inclusion of additional text-frame pairs, enhancing the comprehensiveness of the text list. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `frame_c` (Optional): `frame_c`, if provided, represents the frame identifier for `text_c`. Including this parameter allows for the mapping of `text_c` to a specific frame, further enriching the text list. Type should be `INT`.
        - `text_d` (Optional): `text_d` is an optional fourth piece of text for concatenation. Its provision enables the extension of the text list with more detailed text-frame associations. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `frame_d` (Optional): `frame_d` represents the frame identifier for `text_d` if provided. It plays a key role in associating `text_d` with a specific frame, adding more structure to the text list. Type should be `INT`.
        - `text_e` (Optional): `text_e` is an optional fifth piece of text for concatenation. Including this text allows for a broader representation of text-frame pairs in the text list. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `frame_e` (Optional): `frame_e` represents the frame identifier for `text_e` if provided. It is important for mapping `text_e` to a specific frame, contributing to the detailed structuring of the text list. Type should be `INT`.
        - `text_f` (Optional): `text_f` is an optional sixth piece of text for concatenation. Its inclusion further expands the text list with additional text-frame mappings. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `frame_f` (Optional): `frame_f` represents the frame identifier for `text_f` if provided. Including this parameter enhances the text list by associating `text_f` with a specific frame. Type should be `INT`.
        - `text_g` (Optional): `text_g` is an optional seventh piece of text for concatenation. It allows for the inclusion of more text-frame pairs, maximizing the comprehensiveness of the text list. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `frame_g` (Optional): `frame_g` represents the frame identifier for `text_g` if provided. Its inclusion is crucial for mapping `text_g` to a specific frame, thereby completing the structured text list. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `string`: The output is a structured string that maps frame identifiers to their corresponding texts. This output is significant as it provides a comprehensive and organized representation of text associated with specific frames, facilitating further processing or analysis. Type should be `STRING`.
