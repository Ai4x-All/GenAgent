- `CM_BreakoutVec2`: The CM_BreakoutVec2 node is designed for decomposing a 2-dimensional vector into its individual components, facilitating operations that require access to the separate x and y values.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `a`: The 'a' parameter represents the 2-dimensional vector to be decomposed. It allows for operations on vectors by breaking them down into their individual x and y components. Type should be `VEC2`.
    - Outputs:
        - `float`: The output consists of two float values, representing the x and y components of the input vector, respectively. Type should be `FLOAT`.
