- `CreateFluidMask`: The CreateFluidMask node is designed to generate dynamic fluid-based masks for images, utilizing parameters such as inflow characteristics and dimensions to simulate fluid motion and interactions. This process is aimed at creating visually complex and varied masks that can be applied to images for artistic or processing purposes.
    - Parameters:
        - `invert`: Determines whether the fluid mask should be inverted, affecting the visual representation of the mask in relation to the fluid's motion. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `frames`: Specifies the number of frames to simulate, dictating the duration of the fluid's motion and the complexity of the resulting mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `width`: Sets the width of the mask, defining the horizontal dimension of the fluid simulation space. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Sets the height of the mask, defining the vertical dimension of the fluid simulation space. Type should be `INT`.
        - `inflow_count`: Determines the number of inflow points in the fluid simulation, influencing the number of sources from which fluid enters the space. Type should be `INT`.
        - `inflow_velocity`: Controls the velocity of the inflow, affecting the speed at which fluid enters the simulation space. Type should be `INT`.
        - `inflow_radius`: Specifies the radius of the inflow points, impacting the size of the area through which fluid is introduced. Type should be `INT`.
        - `inflow_padding`: Sets the padding around inflow points, ensuring there is a defined space between the fluid's entry points and the simulation boundaries. Type should be `INT`.
        - `inflow_duration`: Defines the duration for which each inflow point remains active, influencing the overall flow and distribution of fluid within the simulation. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The generated image mask that visually represents the fluid simulation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: A binary mask that delineates the areas affected by the fluid simulation, useful for image processing applications. Type should be `MASK`.
