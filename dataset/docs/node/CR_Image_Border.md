        - `bottom_thickness`: Specifies the thickness of the border at the bottom edge of the image. This parameter enables the user to customize the border's appearance by adjusting its size. Type should be `INT`.
        - `left_thickness`: Specifies the thickness of the border at the left edge of the image. This parameter allows for the customization of the border's appearance by adjusting its size. Type should be `INT`.
        - `right_thickness`: Specifies the thickness of the border at the right edge of the image. This parameter enables the user to customize the border's appearance by adjusting its size. Type should be `INT`.
        - `border_color`: Defines the color of the border. This parameter allows for the customization of the border's appearance by choosing a specific color. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
