- `IF_ChatPrompt`: The IF Chat Prompt node is designed to facilitate interactive chat sessions by generating questions and responses based on image prompts. It leverages various AI engines to interpret visual content and engage users in meaningful dialogue, enhancing the interactive experience within the ComfyUI framework.
    - Parameters:
        - `image_prompt`: A multiline string input that serves as the basis for generating chat prompts, allowing users to describe or upload images for the AI to interpret and respond to. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `base_ip`: Specifies the base IP address of the AI engine server, enabling the node to connect and communicate with the selected AI engine for processing requests. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `port`: Defines the port number for the AI engine server connection, facilitating the node's access to the AI engine's services. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `engine`: Selects the AI engine to be used for generating chat prompts, offering a choice among various options like ollama, kobold, groq, openai, and anthropic. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `profile`: Chooses a user profile that can influence the AI's response style and content, based on predefined profiles within the node. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `max_tokens`: Sets the maximum number of tokens (words) the AI can generate for each response, with a configurable range to control the verbosity of the AI's output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `temperature`: Adjusts the creativity or randomness of the AI's responses, with a scale that influences how predictable or varied the responses will be. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `top_k`: Limits the AI's choices to the top-k most likely next words, focusing the response generation on a narrower set of options. Type should be `INT`.
        - `top_p`: Applies a probability threshold to filter the AI's choices, ensuring that only words with a cumulative probability above this threshold are considered. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `repeat_penalty`: Imposes a penalty on repeating words or phrases, encouraging the AI to produce more diverse and less repetitive responses. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `seed`: unknown Type should be `INT`.
        - `random`: unknown Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `keep_alive`: unknown Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `stop`: unknown Type should be `STRING`.
        - `history_steps`: unknown Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `selected_model`: Allows for the selection of a specific model from the chosen AI engine, although it's currently set to accept an empty tuple, indicating no specific model selection. Type should be `[]`.
        - `image`: unknown Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `Question`: The generated question based on the image prompt, designed to initiate or continue the chat interaction. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `Response`: The AI-generated response to the user's input or question, contributing to the ongoing dialogue. Type should be `STRING`.
