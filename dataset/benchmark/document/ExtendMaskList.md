- `ExtendMaskList`: The ExtendMaskList node is designed to extend a list of masks, allowing for the aggregation of multiple mask elements into a single, comprehensive list. This functionality is crucial for operations that require the manipulation or analysis of multiple masks simultaneously, providing a streamlined approach to handling mask data in bulk.
    - Inputs:
        - `inputs_len` (Required): The 'inputs_len' parameter represents the collection of mask elements to be extended. It plays a pivotal role in the node's operation by serving as the primary data input, which the node then processes to produce an extended list of masks. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The output is an extended list of mask elements, consolidated into a single entity for ease of further processing or analysis. Type should be `MASK`.
