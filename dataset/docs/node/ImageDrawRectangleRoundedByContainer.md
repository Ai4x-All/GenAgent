- `ImageDrawRectangleRoundedByContainer`: This node is designed to draw rounded rectangles within a specified container. It leverages the container's dimensions to determine the drawing area and allows for detailed customization of the rectangle's appearance, including its size, border, fill color, and corner roundness.
    - Parameters:
        - `start_x`: The starting x-coordinate for the rectangle, defining the left boundary of the shape. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_y`: The starting y-coordinate for the rectangle, defining the top boundary of the shape. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_x`: The ending x-coordinate for the rectangle, defining the right boundary of the shape. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_y`: The ending y-coordinate for the rectangle, defining the bottom boundary of the shape. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `radius`: The radius of the corners, determining how rounded the corners of the rectangle will be. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_size`: The thickness of the rectangle's outline. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_red`: The red component of the outline's color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_green`: The green component of the outline's color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_blue`: The blue component of the outline's color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_alpha`: The alpha (transparency) component of the outline's color. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `fill_red`: The red component of the rectangle's fill color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_green`: The green component of the rectangle's fill color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_blue`: The blue component of the rectangle's fill color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_alpha`: The alpha (transparency) component of the rectangle's fill color. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `top_left_corner`: Specifies whether the top left corner should be rounded. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `top_right_corner`: Specifies whether the top right corner should be rounded. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `bottom_right_corner`: Specifies whether the bottom right corner should be rounded. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `bottom_left_corner`: Specifies whether the bottom left corner should be rounded. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `SSAA`: The Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing factor to improve the quality of the drawing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `method`: The method used for drawing, affecting the rendering technique. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `container`: The container within which the rounded rectangle will be drawn. It defines the boundary and context for the drawing operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting image with the rounded rectangle drawn within the specified container. Type should be `IMAGE`.
