- `Batch Float (mtb)`: This node is designed to generate a batch of float values with interpolation, offering flexibility in creating sequences of floats based on various easing functions. It supports different modes of generation, including single value replication or stepped interpolation, making it versatile for various numerical data manipulation needs.
    - Parameters:
        - `mode`: Specifies the mode of float generation, either as a single replicated value or a sequence of values interpolated in steps. This choice affects the pattern and distribution of the generated float values. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `count`: Determines the number of float values to generate, directly influencing the length of the output batch. Type should be `INT`.
        - `min`: Sets the minimum value in the range of generated floats, serving as the starting point for interpolation or the value to replicate in 'Single' mode. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `max`: Defines the maximum value in the range for generated floats, acting as the endpoint for interpolation in 'Steps' mode. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `easing`: Selects the easing function to apply during interpolation, affecting the transition between the min and max values. This parameter allows for the customization of the generated float sequence's progression. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `floats`: The output is a list of float values generated according to the specified mode, count, min, max, and easing parameters. This list can be used for further numerical data processing or visualization. Type should be `FLOATS`.
