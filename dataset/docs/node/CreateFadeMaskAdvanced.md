- `CreateFadeMaskAdvanced`: This node is designed to generate advanced fade masks with customizable parameters, allowing for intricate control over the fade effect's progression, intensity, and spatial distribution. It enables the creation of dynamic visual transitions in image sequences or animations.
    - Parameters:
        - `points_string`: Defines a string of points and their corresponding mask values at specific frames, used to generate the fade effect over the sequence. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `invert`: A boolean flag to invert the mask values, allowing for the creation of inverse fade effects. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `frames`: Specifies the total number of frames for the mask sequence, determining the length of the animation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `width`: Sets the width of the mask, defining the horizontal dimension of the generated mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Sets the height of the mask, defining the vertical dimension of the generated mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `interpolation`: Chooses the interpolation method for transitioning between mask values across frames, affecting the smoothness and style of the fade effect. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: Outputs a batch of masks generated based on the specified parameters, suitable for creating fade effects in image sequences. Type should be `MASK`.
