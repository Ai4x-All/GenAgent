- `Frame Count Calculator [Dream]`: The Frame Count Calculator node is designed to compute the total number of frames based on a given time duration and frame rate. It takes into account hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds to provide a precise frame count, making it essential for animation and video processing tasks where timing and synchronization are critical.
    - Inputs:
        - `hours` (Required): Specifies the number of hours to be included in the total time duration for which frames are to be calculated. It directly influences the total frame count by contributing to the overall time. Type should be `INT`.
        - `minutes` (Required): Specifies the number of minutes to be included in the total time duration. This parameter, along with others, determines the total number of frames by contributing to the total time. Type should be `INT`.
        - `seconds` (Required): Defines the number of seconds to be considered in the total time duration. This is crucial for calculating the precise number of frames, especially in short clips or animations. Type should be `INT`.
        - `milliseconds` (Required): Includes milliseconds in the total time calculation, allowing for more precise frame count calculations in scenarios requiring high accuracy. Type should be `INT`.
        - `frames_per_second` (Required): Sets the frame rate per second, which is used to calculate the total number of frames based on the time duration provided. This parameter is essential for determining the animation or video's smoothness and quality. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `TOTAL`: The total number of frames calculated based on the input time duration and frame rate. This output is crucial for planning and synchronizing animations or video sequences. Type should be `INT`.
