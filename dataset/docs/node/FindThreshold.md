- `FindThreshold`: The FindThreshold node is designed to identify the optimal threshold value for image segmentation or binarization based on specific criteria. It dynamically adjusts the thresholding parameters to meet the desired conditions, enhancing the adaptability and precision of image processing tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `start_at`: The starting point of the threshold value range to be considered. It defines the lower bound of the search space for finding the optimal threshold. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_at`: The ending point of the threshold value range to be considered. It sets the upper limit of the search space for the optimal threshold determination. Type should be `INT`.
        - `thresh_type`: Specifies the type of thresholding to be applied. It influences how the thresholding operation is performed on the image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `downscale_factor`: A factor by which the image is downscaled. This can help in reducing the computational load during the threshold search process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `condition`: A condition that must be met by the thresholded image. It's used to evaluate and select the optimal threshold value. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `src`: The source image on which thresholding needs to be applied. It's crucial for determining the optimal threshold value for segmentation or binarization. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The image after applying the optimal threshold value found. It represents the segmented or binarized version of the source image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
