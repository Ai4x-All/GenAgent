- `FindComplementaryColor`: This node is designed to find a color complementary to the dominant color in an image, based on a given color dictionary and a specified power factor. It optionally allows for the application of a mask to focus the search on a specific area of the image.
    - Parameters:
        - `power`: A factor that influences the selection of the complementary color, adjusting the algorithm's sensitivity or bias towards certain colors. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The image in which to find the complementary color. It serves as the primary input for analysis. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `color_dict`: A dictionary mapping color names to their RGB values, used to identify and compare colors within the image. Type should be `COLOR_DICT`.
        - `mask`: An optional mask that can be applied to the image to limit the search for the complementary color to a specific area. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `color`: The RGB values of the complementary color found in the image. Type should be `COLOR`.
        - `string`: The name of the complementary color found, as defined in the input color dictionary. Type should be `STRING`.
