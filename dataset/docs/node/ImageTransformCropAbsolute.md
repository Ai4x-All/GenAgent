- `ImageTransformCropAbsolute`: This node performs an absolute crop operation on a batch of images, cutting them to a specified rectangular size based on absolute pixel coordinates. It is designed to precisely adjust the dimensions of images by removing unwanted outer portions to focus on a specific area.
    - Parameters:
        - `start_x`: The starting x-coordinate (inclusive) for the crop, defining the left boundary of the cropping rectangle. It determines how much of the left part of the images is removed. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_y`: The starting y-coordinate (inclusive) for the crop, defining the top boundary of the cropping rectangle. It affects the top portion of the images to be cropped out. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_x`: The ending x-coordinate (exclusive) for the crop, defining the right boundary of the cropping rectangle. It specifies the width of the resulting images after cropping. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_y`: The ending y-coordinate (exclusive) for the crop, defining the bottom boundary of the cropping rectangle. It specifies the height of the resulting images after cropping. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The batch of images to be cropped. This parameter is crucial as it directly influences the output by determining which images undergo the cropping process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The cropped images, adjusted to the specified dimensions by removing parts outside the defined rectangular area. Type should be `IMAGE`.
