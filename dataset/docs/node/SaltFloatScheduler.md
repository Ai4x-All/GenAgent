- `SaltFloatScheduler`: The SaltFloatScheduler node is designed for creating and managing float schedules, which are sequences of floating-point values that can be used to control various parameters over time. This node allows for the precise scheduling of float values, enabling dynamic adjustments and temporal control of parameters in audio-visual projects.
    - Parameters:
        - `repeat_sequence_times`: Specifies the number of times the sequence should be repeated, extending the length of the schedule. Type should be `INT`.
        - `curves_mode`: Determines the mode of curve application for the schedule, affecting the shape and progression of values. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `use_perlin_tremors`: Indicates whether to apply Perlin noise to the schedule for generating natural, smooth variations in the float values. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `tremor_scale`: Sets the scale of the Perlin tremors, controlling the frequency of the noise applied. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `tremor_octaves`: Specifies the number of octaves for the Perlin noise, affecting the detail level of the tremors. Type should be `INT`.
        - `tremor_persistence`: Determines the persistence of the Perlin noise, influencing the amplitude of each octave. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `tremor_lacunarity`: Controls the lacunarity of the Perlin noise, which affects the frequency growth per octave. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sequence`: The initial sequence of float values to be scheduled and potentially modified by the node's operations. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `max_sequence_length`: The maximum allowed length of the sequence, ensuring the schedule stays within predefined bounds. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `schedule_list`: The resulting list of floating-point values after scheduling operations, representing the modified or generated schedule. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `schedule_length`: The length of the generated or modified schedule list, indicating the total number of scheduled values. Type should be `INT`.
