- `easy imageSizeBySide`: This node calculates the dimension of an image based on the specified side (longest or shortest), providing a simple way to obtain image resolution metrics.
    - Parameters:
        - `side`: Specifies whether to calculate the dimension based on the longest or shortest side of the image, directly influencing the result by selecting the appropriate dimension. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The image for which the dimension is to be calculated, affecting the output by determining the longest or shortest side based on the image's width and height. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `resolution`: The calculated dimension (width or height) of the specified side (longest or shortest) of the image. Type should be `INT`.
