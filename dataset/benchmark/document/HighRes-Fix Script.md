- `HighRes-Fix Script`: The HighRes-Fix Script node is designed to enhance image resolution and quality in a customizable manner. It leverages various upscaling techniques, control nets, and preprocessing steps to refine images, offering options for seed consistency, denoising, and iterative refinement. This node integrates with animation and control net scripts, adapting to specific high-resolution enhancement needs while maintaining the flexibility to work with different upscaling models and preprocessors.
    - Inputs:
