        - `text2` (Optional): Represents the second optional text input to be concatenated. If provided, it contributes to the final merged string. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text3` (Optional): Represents the third optional text input to be concatenated. If provided, it contributes to the final merged string. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text4` (Optional): Represents the fourth optional text input to be concatenated. If provided, it contributes to the final merged string. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text5` (Optional): Represents the fifth optional text input to be concatenated. If provided, it contributes to the final merged string. Type should be `STRING`.
