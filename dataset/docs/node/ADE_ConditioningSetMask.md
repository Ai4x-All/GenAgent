- `ADE_ConditioningSetMask`: This node is designed to apply a mask to conditioning data, adjusting the area and strength of the conditioning based on specified parameters. It enables the dynamic modification of conditioning inputs to better align with desired outcomes, such as focusing on or excluding specific areas within the data.
    - Parameters:
        - `strength`: Defines the intensity of the mask's effect on the conditioning data, allowing for fine-tuned control over the modification's impact. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `set_cond_area`: Determines whether the mask's effect is applied to the default area or the bounds of the mask, providing flexibility in targeting specific regions. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `cond_ADD`: The conditioning data to be added or modified. This parameter is essential for introducing new contexts or content into the existing conditioning framework. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `opt_mask`: An optional mask that specifies the areas of the conditioning data to be modified, offering additional control over which parts of the conditioning are affected. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `opt_lora_hook`: An optional parameter that allows for the application of Lora hooks to the conditioning, further customizing the conditioning process. Type should be `LORA_HOOK`.
        - `opt_timesteps`: Optional timesteps conditioning, enabling temporal adjustments to the conditioning data. Type should be `TIMESTEPS_COND`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: The modified conditioning data, reflecting the applied mask and adjustments, including any additional conditioning data added. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
