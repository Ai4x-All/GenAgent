- `CR Increment Integer`: This node is designed for the incremental adjustment of integer values over a sequence of frames, providing a means to dynamically alter numerical values based on frame progression within animations or simulations.
    - Parameters:
        - `start_value`: The initial integer value from which the increment operation begins. It serves as the foundational value for subsequent increments, influenced by the 'step' parameter across frames. Type should be `INT`.
        - `step`: The fixed amount added to 'start_value' at each increment step, allowing for consistent or variable progression of the value across frames. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_frame`: The frame at which the increment operation commences, enabling synchronization of value changes with specific points in an animation timeline. Type should be `INT`.
        - `frame_duration`: Defines the duration over which the increment operation is applied, allowing for controlled adjustments within a specified timeframe. Type should be `INT`.
        - `current_frame`: The current frame being processed, determining if and how 'start_value' is incremented based on its relation to 'start_frame' and 'frame_duration'. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `INT`: The resulting integer value after applying the increment operation, reflecting the cumulative effect of the 'step' parameter over the specified frame range. Type should be `INT`.
        - `show_help`: A URL providing access to additional help and documentation related to the node's functionality. Type should be `STRING`.
