- `ThresholdMask`: The ThresholdMask node is designed to convert an image into a binary mask based on a specified threshold value. It evaluates each pixel against the threshold and categorizes it accordingly, facilitating image segmentation or object detection tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `value`: The 'value' parameter sets the threshold for the conversion process. Pixels with values above this threshold will be considered part of the mask, influencing the binary segmentation outcome. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `mask`: The 'mask' parameter represents the input image to be thresholded. It is crucial for determining which pixels will be included in the output mask based on the threshold value. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The output is a binary mask where pixels above the threshold are marked, useful for segmentation or highlighting specific features in an image. Type should be `MASK`.
