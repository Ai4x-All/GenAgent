- `MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor`: The MeshGraphormer-DepthMapPreprocessor node is designed to refine hand depth maps and predict 2D joint positions in image space using a Graphormer-based model. It processes input images to generate enhanced depth maps and corresponding masks, leveraging deep learning techniques for improved hand pose estimation accuracy.
    - Parameters:
        - `mask_bbox_padding`: This parameter defines the padding around detected hand bounding boxes for mask generation, affecting the size and coverage of the output masks. It ensures that the masks adequately encompass the hand regions for accurate depth map refinement. Type should be `INT`.
        - `resolution`: Specifies the resolution at which the input images are processed. This parameter influences the detail level of the generated depth maps and masks. Type should be `INT`.
        - `mask_type`: Specifies the method for generating masks from the depth maps, offering options like 'based_on_depth' for depth-based masks, 'tight_bboxes' for masks based on tight bounding boxes, and 'original' for using the original mask. This choice affects the mask generation strategy and the final output quality. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `mask_expand`: Determines the expansion size of the masks beyond their original boundaries, affecting the coverage area of the masks in the output. This parameter allows for fine-tuning the mask size for better depth map refinement. Type should be `INT`.
        - `rand_seed`: A random seed to ensure reproducibility in the mask and depth map generation process. It helps in maintaining consistency across multiple runs of the node with the same input. Type should be `INT`.
        - `detect_thr`: The detection threshold for the Graphormer model, determining the sensitivity of hand detection within the input images. This parameter influences the model's ability to accurately identify hands in various conditions. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `presence_thr`: The presence threshold for the Graphormer model, affecting the model's confidence in the detected hand's presence within the input images. It plays a significant role in ensuring the reliability of the depth map and 2D joint predictions. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be processed for hand depth map refinement and 2D joint position prediction. It serves as the primary data source for the node's operations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `IMAGE`: The refined depth maps for each hand detected in the input images, providing enhanced detail and accuracy for hand pose estimation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `INPAINTING_MASK`: The generated masks corresponding to the detected hands in the input images, used for isolating hand regions in depth map refinement. Type should be `MASK`.
