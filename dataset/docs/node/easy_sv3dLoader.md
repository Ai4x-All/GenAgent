- `easy sv3dLoader`: The `easy sv3dLoader` node is designed to facilitate the loading of 3D models specifically formatted for Stable Diffusion 3D (SV3D) applications. It streamlines the process of identifying and preparing SV3D model files for use within the ComfyUI framework, ensuring compatibility and ease of integration.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: Specifies the checkpoint name for the 3D model to be loaded. This parameter is crucial for identifying the correct model file among potentially many, based on naming conventions that include 'sv3d' to denote compatibility with Stable Diffusion 3D applications. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `vae_name`: Specifies the VAE model name to be used in conjunction with the 3D model, ensuring the correct visual autoencoder is applied for image generation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `empty_latent_width`: Sets the width of the empty latent space to accommodate the 3D model, adjusting the spatial dimensions for generation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `empty_latent_height`: Sets the height of the empty latent space to accommodate the 3D model, adjusting the spatial dimensions for generation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `batch_size`: Determines the number of instances to process in parallel, optimizing the loading and manipulation of 3D models for efficiency. Type should be `INT`.
        - `interp_easing`: Specifies the easing function to apply during the interpolation of frames, affecting the smoothness and dynamics of the 3D model's animation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `easing_mode`: Defines the mode of easing to be applied, such as azimuth or elevation, directing the interpolation's focus during 3D model manipulation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Optional scheduler settings for advanced control over the loading and processing sequence of the 3D model, allowing for customized generation workflows. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `init_image`: Defines the initial image to start the generation process, serving as a base or reference for the 3D model loading and manipulation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The pipeline configuration for processing the 3D model, encapsulating the sequence of operations and transformations applied. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model`: The loaded 3D model ready for manipulation and integration within the ComfyUI framework, presented in a compatible format. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `interp_log`: A log of the interpolation and easing operations applied to the 3D model, providing insights into the manipulation process. Type should be `STRING`.
