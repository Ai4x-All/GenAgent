- `easy cascadeLoader`: The `cascadeLoader` node is designed to facilitate the loading and initialization of models for cascading generation processes. It abstracts the complexities involved in setting up the necessary components for cascade-based model operations, aiming to streamline the process of model preparation for subsequent generative tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `stage_c`: Specifies the 'C' stage latent representation required for the cascade process, indicating the initial layer of image generation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `stage_b`: Denotes the 'B' stage latent representation in the cascade process, serving as an intermediate layer for further image detail enhancement. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `stage_a`: Indicates the 'A' stage latent representation, setting the foundation for the cascade process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clip_name`: Specifies the CLIP model to be used in the cascade process, influencing the direction of image generation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lora_name`: Selects the LoRA model for adjustment of model parameters, enhancing the cascade process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lora_model_strength`: Determines the strength of the LoRA model adjustments, impacting the final image generation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `lora_clip_strength`: Sets the strength of CLIP guidance in the LoRA model, affecting the image's adherence to textual descriptions. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `resolution`: Specifies the desired resolution for the output of the cascade process, formatted as strings indicating width and height (e.g., '1024 x 768'). This parameter is crucial for determining the size of the generated images and ensuring they meet the user's requirements. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `empty_latent_width`: Defines the width of the empty latent space to be used in the cascade process, affecting the dimensions of the generated image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `empty_latent_height`: Defines the height of the empty latent space to be used in the cascade process, affecting the dimensions of the generated image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `compression`: Sets the compression level for the latent representations, influencing the detail and size of the generated images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `positive`: The positive textual prompt guiding the image generation process towards desired characteristics. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `negative`: The negative textual prompt guiding the image generation away from undesired characteristics. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `batch_size`: Specifies the number of images to be generated in a single batch, affecting the cascade process's efficiency. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `optional_lora_stack`: Optionally includes a stack of LoRA models for enhanced customization of the cascade process. Type should be `LORA_STACK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The complete pipeline configuration for the cascade process, encapsulating all stages and model settings. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model_c`: The model configuration for the 'C' stage of the cascade process, essential for initiating the image generation. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `latent_c`: The latent representation at the 'C' stage, forming the basis for subsequent image generation stages. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `vae`: The VAE model used in the cascade process, crucial for encoding and decoding images. Type should be `VAE`.
