- `FromListGetLatents`: The node 'FromListGetLatents' is designed to extract multiple latent representations from a provided list. It enables the selection and manipulation of latent data structures, facilitating operations such as retrieval, analysis, and transformation of latent vectors.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `list`: Specifies the list of latent representations from which to extract elements. This parameter is crucial for defining the source of latent data to be operated on. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The extracted latent representations from the specified list. This output is significant for further processing or analysis of the latent vectors. Type should be `LATENT`.
