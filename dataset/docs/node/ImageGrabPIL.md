- `ImageGrabPIL`: The ImageGrabPIL node is designed to capture and process images from the screen using the PIL library. It focuses on grabbing screen content, possibly for further manipulation or analysis within a larger image processing or computer vision workflow.
    - Parameters:
        - `x`: Specifies the starting x-coordinate for the screen capture area, affecting the horizontal position of the capture region. Type should be `INT`.
        - `y`: Specifies the starting y-coordinate for the screen capture area, influencing the vertical position of the capture region. Type should be `INT`.
        - `width`: Defines the width of the screen capture area, determining how wide the captured image will be. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Defines the height of the screen capture area, determining the height of the captured image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `num_frames`: Indicates the number of frames to capture, useful for creating a sequence of images over time. Type should be `INT`.
        - `delay`: Sets the delay between captures when multiple frames are being captured, controlling the timing of captures. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The captured image or sequence of images from the specified screen area. Type should be `IMAGE`.
