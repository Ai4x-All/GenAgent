    - Inputs:
        - `file_path` (Required): The complete file path from which the basename is to be extracted. This input is crucial for determining the specific file or directory name at the end of the path. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `path_basename`: The basename of the provided file path, which is the file name and extension or the final directory name in the path. Type should be `STRING`.
