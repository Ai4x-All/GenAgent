- `FromDetailerPipeSDXL`: The FromDetailerPipeSDXL node is designed to extract and return various components from a detailer pipe, including models, clips, VAEs, conditioning elements, bounding box detectors, SAM models, segmentation detectors, and detailer hooks. It serves as a mechanism to decompose a complex detailer pipe into its constituent parts for further processing or analysis.
    - Inputs:
        - `detailer_pipe` (Required): Represents the detailer pipe from which components are to be extracted. It is crucial for specifying the source of the data to be decomposed. Type should be `DETAILER_PIPE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `detailer_pipe`: Returns the entire detailer pipe as received, allowing for further manipulation or analysis. Type should be `DETAILER_PIPE`.
        - `model`: Returns the model component extracted from the detailer pipe. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: Returns the clip component extracted from the detailer pipe. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `vae`: Returns the VAE component extracted from the detailer pipe. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `positive`: Returns the positive conditioning element extracted from the detailer pipe. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Returns the negative conditioning element extracted from the detailer pipe. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `bbox_detector`: Returns the bounding box detector component extracted from the detailer pipe. Type should be `BBOX_DETECTOR`.
        - `sam_model_opt`: Returns the SAM model component extracted from the detailer pipe, if available. Type should be `SAM_MODEL`.
        - `segm_detector_opt`: Returns the segmentation detector component extracted from the detailer pipe, if available. Type should be `SEGM_DETECTOR`.
        - `detailer_hook`: Returns the detailer hook component extracted from the detailer pipe. Type should be `DETAILER_HOOK`.
        - `refiner_model`: Returns the refiner model component extracted from the detailer pipe. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `refiner_clip`: Returns the refiner clip component extracted from the detailer pipe. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `refiner_positive`: Returns the refiner positive conditioning element extracted from the detailer pipe. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `refiner_negative`: Returns the refiner negative conditioning element extracted from the detailer pipe. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
