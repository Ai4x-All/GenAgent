- `AnimateDiffLoaderV1`: This node is designed for the initialization and preparation of the AnimateDiff model, facilitating its readiness for animation generation tasks. It abstracts the complexities involved in loading the model, ensuring it is set up correctly for subsequent use.
    - Parameters:
        - `model_name`: Used to select a specific motion model from available options, this parameter ensures the correct version of the AnimateDiff model is loaded based on the provided name. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `unlimited_area_hack`: A boolean parameter that, when enabled, applies a specific hack to bypass limitations on the area that can be animated, offering more flexibility in animation tasks. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `beta_schedule`: Specifies the beta schedule to be used during the model's operation, influencing the behavior and performance of the AnimateDiff model. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: This parameter is used to specify the AnimateDiff model to be loaded, enabling the node to correctly initialize and prepare the model for animation tasks. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `latents`: This parameter allows for the specification of latent vectors that may be required for initializing the model, providing a way to customize the model's starting state. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: This output represents the loaded AnimateDiff model, ready for animation generation tasks. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `latent`: Outputs the latent vectors associated with the loaded model, which can be used for further customization or animation processes. Type should be `LATENT`.
