- `ImpactMakeTileSEGS`: The ImpactMakeTileSEGS node is designed to process segmentation masks (SEGS) to generate tiled versions of these masks based on specified bounding box sizes and overlap parameters. It applies various filtering and adjustment techniques to ensure the tiles are generated in a manner that respects the original segmentation's integrity and spatial distribution, accommodating for both inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as handling irregularities in mask shapes.
    - Parameters:
        - `bbox_size`: Determines the size of the bounding box for each tile, directly influencing the granularity of the tiling output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_factor`: A factor that influences the cropping of images during the tiling process, affecting the size and area of the resulting tiles. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `min_overlap`: Specifies the minimum overlap between adjacent tiles, ensuring a seamless transition and coverage across tiles. Type should be `INT`.
        - `filter_segs_dilation`: Specifies the dilation applied to segmentation masks, adjusting the area covered by each segment for inclusion or exclusion in the tiling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `mask_irregularity`: Defines the level of irregularity to be applied to the masks, affecting the shape and edges of the tiles. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `irregular_mask_mode`: Specifies the mode of generating irregular masks, influencing the quality and reuse strategy of masks for tiling. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The images to be processed for tiling, serving as the base for segmentation and subsequent tiling operations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `filter_in_segs_opt`: Defines segmentation masks to be included in the tiling process, allowing for targeted tiling within specified regions of interest. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `filter_out_segs_opt`: Specifies segmentation masks to be excluded from the tiling process, enhancing the node's ability to focus on regions of interest by removing undesired segments. Type should be `SEGS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `segs`: The output consists of segmented tiles, each representing a portion of the original image with applied filters and adjustments for tiling. Type should be `SEGS`.
