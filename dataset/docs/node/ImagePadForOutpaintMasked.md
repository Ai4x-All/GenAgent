- `ImagePadForOutpaintMasked`: This node is designed to facilitate the outpainting process by padding images with a masked area, allowing for seamless integration of newly generated image parts with existing content. It employs various image processing techniques, including masking, blending, and filtering, to achieve a natural-looking extension of the image beyond its original boundaries.
    - Parameters:
        - `left`: The width of the padding to be added to the left side of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `top`: The height of the padding to be added to the top of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `right`: The width of the padding to be added to the right side of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `bottom`: The height of the padding to be added to the bottom of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `feathering`: The degree of feathering applied to the edges of the mask, blending the padded area with the original image. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The original image to be processed, serving as the base for the outpainting operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: The mask indicating areas to be outpainted, guiding the application of padding and blending techniques. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The modified image with applied padding and masking for outpainting. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: The updated mask reflecting the changes made during the outpainting process. Type should be `MASK`.
