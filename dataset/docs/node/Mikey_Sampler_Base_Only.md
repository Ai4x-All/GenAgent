- `Mikey Sampler Base Only`: The Mikey Sampler Base Only node is designed for basic sampling operations within a specific framework, focusing on generating samples from a given input without the advanced features found in other variants. It serves as a foundational element for more complex sampling processes, providing a streamlined and efficient approach to sample generation.
    - Parameters:
        - `model_name`: The name of the model used for upscaling the generated samples, enhancing their resolution or quality. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed`: The 'seed' parameter ensures the reproducibility of the sampling process by initializing the random number generator with a specific value. This allows for consistent results across multiple runs, making it essential for experiments and comparisons. Type should be `INT`.
        - `upscale_by`: The factor by which the samples are upscaled, improving their resolution or detail. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `hires_strength`: Determines the strength of high-resolution features in the upscaled samples, affecting their clarity and detail. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `smooth_step`: Controls the smoothness of the transition between steps in the sampling process, affecting the gradual evolution of samples. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `base_model`: The 'base_model' parameter specifies the model used for the sampling process, serving as the foundation for generating samples. It is crucial for defining the behavior and capabilities of the sampling operation. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `samples`: The 'samples' parameter represents the initial set of samples or data points that the sampling process will use or modify. It is essential for starting the sampling operation with a predefined set of conditions or states. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `positive_cond_base`: Specifies the positive conditioning to guide the sampling towards desired attributes or features. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative_cond_base`: Specifies the negative conditioning to steer the sampling away from undesired attributes or features. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `vae`: The VAE (Variational Autoencoder) used in the sampling process for generating or refining samples. Type should be `VAE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The output is a latent representation generated based on the input parameters, including the base model, samples, and seed. This latent representation captures the essence of the input in a form suitable for further processing or generation. Type should be `LATENT`.
