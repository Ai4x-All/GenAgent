- `SeargePromptAdapterV2`: The SeargePromptAdapterV2 node is designed to adapt input prompts for further processing or generation tasks, enabling customization and refinement of text inputs to fit specific requirements or formats.
    - Inputs:
        - `data` (Optional): This input represents a data stream that can include various types of information, serving as a flexible container for inputs that the node can process or transform. Type should be `SRG_DATA_STREAM`.
        - `main_prompt` (Optional): Captures the primary text prompt intended for guiding the generation process, focusing on the main subject or theme. Type should be `SRG_PROMPT_TEXT`.
        - `secondary_prompt` (Optional): This input captures additional text prompts that complement the main prompt, offering further context or detail. Type should be `SRG_PROMPT_TEXT`.
        - `style_prompt` (Optional): Specifies a style or tone for the text generation, influencing the mood or character of the output. Type should be `SRG_PROMPT_TEXT`.
        - `negative_main_prompt` (Optional): Captures negative text prompts to avoid certain topics or attributes in the generation process. Type should be `SRG_PROMPT_TEXT`.
        - `negative_secondary_prompt` (Optional): Additional negative prompts that help refine the filtering process by excluding undesired elements. Type should be `SRG_PROMPT_TEXT`.
        - `negative_style_prompt` (Optional): Defines a style or tone to be avoided in the text generation, ensuring the output does not carry undesired characteristics. Type should be `SRG_PROMPT_TEXT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `data`: A data stream that includes the processed or transformed inputs, ready for further use or generation tasks. Type should be `SRG_DATA_STREAM`.
        - `prompts`: A collection of prompts, both positive and negative, formatted and ready for use in generation tasks. Type should be `SRG_DATA_STREAM`.
