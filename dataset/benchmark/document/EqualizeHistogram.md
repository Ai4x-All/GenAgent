- `EqualizeHistogram`: The EqualizeHistogram node is designed to enhance the contrast of an image by equalizing its histogram. This process redistributes the intensity levels of the image, potentially improving its visual perception.
    - Inputs:
        - `src` (Required): The source image to be processed for histogram equalization. This input is crucial as it directly influences the enhancement of the image's contrast. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is an enhanced image with equalized histogram, aimed at improving the contrast and visual quality. Type should be `IMAGE`.
