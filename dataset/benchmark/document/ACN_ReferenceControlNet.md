- `ACN_ReferenceControlNet`: The ACN_ReferenceControlNet node is designed to load and apply a Reference ControlNet configuration for advanced control in generative models. It allows for the customization of reference types, style fidelity, and reference weight to fine-tune the influence of the control net on the generative process.
    - Inputs:
        - `reference_type` (Required): Specifies the type of reference to be used, affecting how the control net interprets and applies style and content guidance. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `style_fidelity` (Required): Determines the fidelity of the style to be applied by the control net, influencing the balance between style and content in the generated output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `ref_weight` (Required): Controls the weight of the reference in the control net's decision-making process, adjusting the overall impact of the reference on the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `control_net`: The configured Reference ControlNet, ready to be applied to the generative model for influencing its output. Type should be `CONTROL_NET`.
