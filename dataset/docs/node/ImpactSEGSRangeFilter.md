- `ImpactSEGSRangeFilter`: The ImpactSEGSRangeFilter node is designed to filter segments (SEGS) based on specified range criteria. It evaluates each segment against given parameters such as area, width, height, or specific coordinates, and segregates them into new segments that meet or do not meet the criteria. This functionality is crucial for refining segment selection based on geometric properties.
    - Parameters:
        - `target`: Specifies the geometric property (e.g., area, width, height, x1, y1, x2, y2, length_percent) based on which the segments will be filtered. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `mode`: Determines the filtering mode. If true, segments within the specified range are included; if false, segments outside the range are included. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `min_value`: The minimum value of the specified geometric property for a segment to be included or excluded, depending on the mode. Type should be `INT`.
        - `max_value`: The maximum value of the specified geometric property for a segment to be included or excluded, depending on the mode. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `segs`: The input segments to be filtered. It's the primary data upon which the range filtering operation is performed. Type should be `SEGS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `filtered_SEGS`: Returns the segments that meet the specified criteria. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `remained_SEGS`: Returns the segments that do not meet the specified criteria. Type should be `SEGS`.
