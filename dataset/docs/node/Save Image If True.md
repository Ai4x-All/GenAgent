        - `filename_prefix`: An optional prefix for the saved filename, allowing for organized storage and easy retrieval of saved images. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The image to potentially save. It is central to the node's operation as it determines what content is subject to conditional saving. Type should be `IMAGE`.
