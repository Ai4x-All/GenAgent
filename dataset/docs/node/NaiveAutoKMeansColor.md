- `NaiveAutoKMeansColor`: This node is designed to automatically determine the optimal number of colors for K-means clustering on an image, without requiring the user to specify the number of colors. It iteratively applies K-means clustering with increasing numbers of clusters until a certain criteria is met, simplifying the process of color quantization for images.
    - Parameters:
        - `max_k`: The maximum number of clusters to consider for K-means clustering. This parameter sets an upper limit on the number of colors the algorithm will attempt to quantify. Type should be `INT`.
        - `rc_threshold`: A threshold for the relative compactness of clusters, used to decide if the current number of clusters is optimal. It helps in identifying the 'elbow' in the compactness graph, which signifies the most efficient number of clusters, balancing detail preservation and computational efficiency. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `max_iterations`: The maximum number of iterations to perform for each K-means clustering attempt. This parameter helps to control the computational complexity of the algorithm. Type should be `INT`.
        - `eps`: The epsilon value for convergence. If the change in centroids is less than this value, the algorithm will stop, indicating convergence. This parameter is crucial for determining when the algorithm has sufficiently minimized within-cluster variance, thus affecting the precision of the color quantization. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be processed for color quantization. The node applies K-means clustering to this image to find the optimal number of colors. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The processed image reflecting the optimal number of colors determined by the K-means clustering algorithm. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `int`: The optimal number of colors determined by the algorithm. Type should be `INT`.
