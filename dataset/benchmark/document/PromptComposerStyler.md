It enables the dynamic adjustment of text presentation by applying stylistic modifications, thereby enhancing the expressiveness and specificity of the generated prompts.

        - `active` (Required): A boolean parameter that activates or deactivates the styling function. When false, the styling is not applied. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `text_in_opt` (Optional): An optional text input that, if provided, is included in the styled prompt. It serves as the base text to which the style is applied. Type should be `STRING`.
