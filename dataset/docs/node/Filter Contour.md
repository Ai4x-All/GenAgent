- `Filter Contour`: The Filter Contour node is designed to process and filter contours based on a given fitness function and selection criteria. It allows for the dynamic evaluation and selection of contours from an image, utilizing custom logic to determine the most suitable contours for further processing or analysis.
    - Parameters:
        - `fitness`: A custom fitness function used to evaluate each contour. This function plays a crucial role in determining which contours are selected for output, based on their fitness scores. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `select`: The selection criteria used to choose contours after they have been evaluated by the fitness function. This parameter dictates how the filtered contours are selected for output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `contours`: A collection of contours to be filtered. This parameter is central to the node's operation, as it provides the raw data that will be processed according to the fitness function and selection criteria. Type should be `CV_CONTOURS`.
        - `image`: An optional image parameter that can be used within the fitness function for contour evaluation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `aux_contour`: An optional auxiliary contour that can be used within the fitness function for comparative analysis. Type should be `CV_CONTOUR`.
    - Outputs:
        - `cv_contour`: The primary output consists of a single selected contour, filtered based on the provided fitness function and selection criteria. Type should be `CV_CONTOUR`.
        - `cv_contours`: The secondary output consists of all contours that were evaluated and potentially filtered based on the fitness function and selection criteria, including the primary selected contour. Type should be `CV_CONTOURS`.
