- `SRIntPromptInput`: The SRIntPromptInput node is designed to integrate an integer input into a structured prompt, enhancing it with specific numerical data. This node plays a crucial role in customizing prompts with integer values, thereby enabling more precise and context-aware generation processes.
    - Inputs:
        - `input_int` (Required): The primary integer input required for the operation. It directly influences the customization of the prompt by adding a numerical value. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `output_int`: The integer input after being processed and integrated into the prompt, reflecting the customization applied. Type should be `INT`.
