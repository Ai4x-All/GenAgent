- `Conditioning Grid (cond)`: This node is designed to apply conditioning to a grid structure, enabling the customization of content generation based on specific grid coordinates. It facilitates the creation of complex, grid-based conditioning scenarios, allowing for detailed control over the generation process.
    - Parameters:
        - `columns`: Specifies the number of columns in the grid, determining the grid's horizontal dimension. Type should be `INT`.
        - `rows`: Defines the number of rows in the grid, setting the grid's vertical dimension. Type should be `INT`.
        - `width`: The width of each grid cell, influencing the spatial resolution of the conditioning applied. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The height of each grid cell, affecting the spatial resolution of the conditioning applied. Type should be `INT`.
        - `strength`: Determines the intensity of the conditioning effect, allowing for fine-tuning of the generated content's characteristics. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `base`: The base conditioning that serves as the starting point for further modifications. It's crucial for establishing the initial context or theme of the generated content. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: The conditioned output, representing the modified grid structure with applied conditioning. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
