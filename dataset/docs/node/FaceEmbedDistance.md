- `FaceEmbedDistance`: The FaceEmbedDistance node is designed to extract facial embeddings from an image using specified face analysis models. It supports different libraries for face detection and embedding extraction, providing a flexible approach to obtaining normalized face embeddings or descriptors for further analysis.
    - Parameters:
        - `filter_thresh_eucl`: This input sets the Euclidean distance threshold for filtering face embeddings. It is used to determine the similarity between faces based on Euclidean distance. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `filter_thresh_cos`: This input sets the cosine similarity threshold for filtering face embeddings. It is used to determine the similarity between faces based on cosine similarity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `filter_best`: This input specifies the number of best matches to retain after filtering based on the specified thresholds. It allows for narrowing down the most similar faces. Type should be `INT`.
        - `generate_image_overlay`: This boolean input determines whether to generate an overlay image showing the comparison results between the reference and target faces. It enhances the visual analysis of face similarity. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `analysis_models`: The analysis models input specifies the face analysis models to be used for detecting faces and extracting embeddings. It is essential for configuring the node to use the appropriate library and models for face analysis. Type should be `ANALYSIS_MODELS`.
        - `reference`: The reference input is an image against which the face embeddings are to be compared. It is used in the context of analyzing the distance or similarity between faces. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image`: The image input is the primary data the node processes to extract facial embeddings. It plays a crucial role in the face analysis process, as the quality and characteristics of the image directly influence the accuracy and effectiveness of the embedding extraction. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `IMAGE`: The output image may include visual representations of the analysis, such as overlays or annotations to indicate detected faces or similarities. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `euclidean`: The Euclidean distance output provides a measure of the similarity between the analyzed faces based on Euclidean distance. It is crucial for tasks requiring precise face comparison. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `cosine`: The cosine similarity output provides a measure of the similarity between the analyzed faces based on cosine similarity. It is used for comparing the orientation of the face embeddings in the vector space. Type should be `FLOAT`.
