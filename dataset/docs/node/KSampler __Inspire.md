- `KSampler __Inspire`: The KSampler __Inspire node is designed to facilitate the generation of creative content by sampling from a model in a manner that is inspired by specific inputs. It abstracts the complexity of sampling algorithms, providing an interface for generating novel outputs based on positive and negative prompts, style guidance, and other parameters.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: Sets the initial seed for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the sampling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Determines the number of steps to perform in the sampling process, affecting the detail and quality of the generated output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Configures the conditioning-free guidance scale, influencing the strength of the conditioning on the generation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Selects the specific sampling algorithm to use, tailoring the generation process to the desired characteristics. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Chooses the scheduler for controlling the sampling process, further customizing the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: Adjusts the level of denoising applied during the generation, affecting the clarity and coherence of the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `noise_mode`: Selects the mode of noise application, influencing the texture and details of the generated output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `batch_seed_mode`: Determines the mode for seed generation and application throughout the batch processing, affecting the variability of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `variation_seed`: Specifies a seed for introducing variations, adding an additional layer of randomness to the generation process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `variation_strength`: Controls the strength of the variations introduced by the variation seed, influencing the diversity of the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: Specifies the model from which to sample, serving as the foundation for generating outputs. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `positive`: Specifies the positive conditioning to guide the generation towards desired attributes or themes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Defines the negative conditioning that the generation should avoid, steering the output away from undesired attributes or themes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent_image`: Provides an initial latent image to be modified or enhanced through the sampling process. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: Produces a latent representation of the generated content, encapsulating the desired attributes influenced by the input conditioning. Type should be `LATENT`.
