- `Power Prompt - Simple (rgthree)`: The Power Prompt - Simple node is designed to simplify the process of generating conditioning and text outputs based on a given prompt. It optionally incorporates CLIP embeddings and allows for the insertion of pre-saved prompts or embeddings, streamlining the creation of customized text inputs for further processing.
    - Parameters:
        - `prompt`: The primary text input for which conditioning and text outputs are generated. It serves as the base content for further modifications or enhancements. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `insert_embedding`: Allows for the insertion of a pre-saved embedding by name, enabling the customization of the prompt with specific, pre-defined characteristics. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `insert_saved`: Permits the inclusion of a pre-saved prompt by filename, facilitating the reuse of previously crafted prompts for new generations. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `opt_clip`: An optional CLIP model input that, if provided, is used to generate a conditioning output based on the prompt, enhancing the relevance or specificity of the generated text. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `CONDITIONING`: The conditioning output, generated based on the prompt and optionally enhanced by a CLIP model, which can be used for further processing or refinement. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `TEXT`: The original or modified prompt text, which can be used as input for subsequent operations or models. Type should be `STRING`.
