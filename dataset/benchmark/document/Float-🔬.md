- `Float-ðŸ”¬`: The Float node is designed to process numerical floating-point values, allowing for precision adjustments and mathematical operations within a logic-based framework.
    - Inputs:
        - `value` (Required): Represents the floating-point number to be processed or manipulated. Its importance lies in being the primary data that the node operates on, affecting the outcome of the node's execution. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `FLOAT`: Outputs the processed or manipulated floating-point number, reflecting the result of the node's operations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
