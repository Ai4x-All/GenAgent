- `CR Load Scheduled Models`: This node is designed to dynamically load and switch between different models based on a predefined schedule for animation frames. It facilitates the use of various models at specific points in an animation sequence, enhancing the flexibility and diversity of the generated content.
    - Parameters:
        - `mode`: Specifies the operational mode of the node, which determines how models are loaded and switched during the animation process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `current_frame`: Indicates the current frame number in the animation sequence, used to determine the appropriate model to load based on the schedule. Type should be `INT`.
        - `schedule_alias`: Serves as an identifier to match the schedule with the correct model, enabling the dynamic loading of models as per the animation frame requirements. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `default_model`: The default model to be used when no specific model is scheduled for the current frame. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `schedule_format`: Defines the format of the schedule, which influences how the schedule is interpreted and applied to model loading. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model_list`: A list of models available for scheduling. This allows for the selection of different models to be loaded at specified frames. Type should be `MODEL_LIST`.
        - `schedule`: Defines the timing and model selection for each frame in the animation, dictating which model to load at any given point. Type should be `SCHEDULE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `MODEL`: The model loaded as per the current frame and schedule. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `CLIP`: The CLIP model loaded, if specified in the schedule. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `VAE`: The VAE model loaded, if specified in the schedule. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `show_help`: Provides help or guidance related to the scheduling and model loading process. Type should be `STRING`.
