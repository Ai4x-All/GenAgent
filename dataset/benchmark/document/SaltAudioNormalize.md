- `SaltAudioNormalize`: The SaltAudioNormalize node is designed to normalize audio files, adjusting their volume levels to a consistent amplitude. This process enhances the audio quality by ensuring that the sound is neither too loud nor too soft, making it ideal for preparing audio for further processing or playback.
    - Inputs:
        - `audio` (Required): The 'audio' input is the raw audio data that needs normalization. It is crucial for the node's operation as it directly influences the outcome of the normalization process. Type should be `AUDIO`.
    - Outputs:
        - `audio`: The 'audio' output is the normalized version of the input audio. It represents the result of the normalization process, with adjusted volume levels for consistent amplitude. Type should be `AUDIO`.
