- `HEDPreprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS __Inspire`: This node provides a preprocessor for SEGS (semantic edge guided synthesis) using the HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection) algorithm. It is designed to preprocess images by detecting edges in a holistic manner, enhancing the input for SEGS applications.
    - Inputs:
        - `safe` (Required): Determines whether the preprocessing should be performed in a safe mode, which may affect the edge detection results. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Outputs:
        - `segs_preprocessor`: The output is a preprocessed object ready for SEGS applications, specifically tailored for edge detection enhancements. Type should be `SEGS_PREPROCESSOR`.
