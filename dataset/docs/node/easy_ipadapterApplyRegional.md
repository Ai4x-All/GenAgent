- `easy ipadapterApplyRegional`: This node specializes in applying regional adaptations to images using IPAdapter, enhancing or modifying specific areas based on given parameters. It leverages the IPAdapter's capabilities to adjust and refine image content, focusing on regional specificity to achieve desired visual outcomes.
    - Parameters:
        - `positive`: A string parameter used to define positive adjustments or enhancements to be applied to specific regions of the image. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `negative`: A string parameter used to define negative adjustments or modifications to be applied to specific regions of the image, counteracting or balancing the positive enhancements. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `image_weight`: Specifies the weight of the image in the adaptation process, influencing the degree to which the image is modified. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `prompt_weight`: Determines the weight of the prompt in the adaptation process, affecting the intensity of the applied changes. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weight_type`: Defines the type of weighting applied to the adaptations, such as linear or exponential, influencing how adjustments are scaled. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_at`: Indicates the starting point of the adaptation effect within the image, allowing for gradual application of changes. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_at`: Specifies the endpoint of the adaptation effect within the image, enabling precise control over where modifications cease. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Specifies the pipeline configuration to be used, indicating how the image processing should be structured and executed. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `image`: The image to which regional adaptations will be applied, serving as the primary input for the transformation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: An optional parameter that allows for the application of adaptations to specific areas of the image, defined by the mask. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `optional_ipadapter_params`: Optional parameters for further customization of the IPAdapter's behavior, offering additional control over the adaptation process. Type should be `IPADAPTER_PARAMS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The modified pipeline configuration after applying regional adaptations, reflecting any changes made during the process. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `ipadapter_params`: The parameters used or modified within the IPAdapter during the adaptation process, detailing the specific adjustments applied. Type should be `IPADAPTER_PARAMS`.
        - `positive`: The positive embeddings or adjustments generated as a result of the adaptation process, applied to enhance specific regions of the image. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: The negative embeddings or adjustments generated, used to counterbalance or modify specific areas of the image in contrast to the positive enhancements. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
