- `Face Swap (mtb)`: The Face Swap node enables the swapping of faces between two images using deep learning models. It leverages face analysis to identify faces in the source and target images and applies a face swap model to replace the target image's face with that of the source image, supporting single or multiple faces swapping.
    - Parameters:
        - `faces_index`: A string specifying the indices of the faces in the target image to be swapped. It allows selective swapping of faces when multiple are present. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The image tensor where the face(s) will be swapped into. It serves as the target image for the face swap operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `reference`: The reference image tensor providing the face(s) to be swapped into the target image. It acts as the source of the face(s) for the swapping process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `faceanalysis_model`: The model used for analyzing faces within the images. It's crucial for detecting and preparing faces for the swapping process. Type should be `FACE_ANALYSIS_MODEL`.
        - `faceswap_model`: The model responsible for the actual face swapping. It performs the core operation of replacing the target face with the source face. Type should be `FACESWAP_MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting image tensor after the face swap has been performed, with the target face(s) replaced by the source face(s). Type should be `IMAGE`.
