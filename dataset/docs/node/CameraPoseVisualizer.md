- `CameraPoseVisualizer`: The CameraPoseVisualizer node is designed to visualize camera poses in a 3D plot, either from a specified file containing camera intrinsics and coordinates or from camera control poses provided directly. It supports adjusting the visualization scale, base values, and whether to use exact focal lengths or a relative camera-to-world transformation, enhancing the understanding of camera positioning and orientation in a given space.
    - Parameters:
        - `pose_file_path`: Specifies the path to a file containing camera poses or an empty string if camera control poses are provided directly. This parameter is crucial for determining the source of camera poses to visualize. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `base_xval`: Determines the base x-value for the camera pyramid visualization, affecting the positioning of camera representations in the plot. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `zval`: Sets the z-value for the camera pyramid visualization, influencing the depth positioning of camera representations in the plot. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `scale`: Adjusts the scale of the entire visualization, allowing for zooming in or out of the scene. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `use_exact_fx`: A boolean flag that decides whether to use exact focal lengths from the camera poses or a default value, affecting the accuracy of the visualization. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `relative_c2w`: Determines whether the camera-to-world transformation is relative, influencing the orientation and positioning of camera representations. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `use_viewer`: A boolean flag indicating whether to use an external viewer for the visualization, offering an alternative display method. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `cameractrl_poses`: Directly provides camera control poses for visualization, offering an alternative to specifying a pose file path. Type should be `CAMERACTRL_POSES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is a visual representation of camera poses in a 3D plot, showcasing the spatial arrangement and orientation of cameras. Type should be `IMAGE`.
