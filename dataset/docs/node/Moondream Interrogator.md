- `Moondream Interrogator`: The Moondream Interrogator node leverages the Moondream visual language model to generate textual descriptions based on input images and prompts. It dynamically adjusts to model revisions, supports device selection, and incorporates temperature settings for response variability.
    - Parameters:
        - `prompt`: A textual prompt that guides the model in generating descriptions for the input image. It influences the context and specificity of the generated text. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `separator`: A string used to separate multiple descriptions in the output, allowing for clear delineation between different generated texts. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `model_revision`: Specifies the revision of the Moondream model to use, enabling the selection of different model versions for varied outputs. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `temperature`: Controls the randomness of the generated descriptions, affecting the variability and creativity of the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `device`: Determines the computational device (CPU or GPU) on which the model runs, impacting performance and efficiency. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `trust_remote_code`: A security setting that must be enabled to use remote code execution within the Moondream model. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image tensor to be analyzed and described by the Moondream model. It plays a crucial role in generating the textual output. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `description`: The generated textual descriptions for the input image, influenced by the provided prompt and model settings. Type should be `STRING`.
