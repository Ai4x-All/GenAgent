- `JoinImageWithAlpha`: This node is designed for compositing operations, specifically to join an image with its corresponding alpha mask to produce a single output image. It effectively combines visual content with transparency information, enabling the creation of images where certain areas are transparent or semi-transparent.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The main visual content to be combined with an alpha mask. It represents the image without transparency information. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `alpha`: The alpha mask that defines the transparency of the corresponding image. It is used to determine which parts of the image should be transparent or semi-transparent. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is a single image that combines the input image with the alpha mask, incorporating transparency information into the visual content. Type should be `IMAGE`.
