- `ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine5`: This node is designed to apply masks to conditioning data, combining multiple sets of conditioning and masks with varying strengths. It allows for the selective enhancement or suppression of features within the conditioning data based on the masks applied, facilitating complex conditioning scenarios for generative models.
    - Parameters:
        - `mask_i_strength`: Defines the strength of the mask applied to the set of conditioning data, influencing the degree of feature enhancement or suppression. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `set_cond_area`: Determines whether to set the conditioning area to the bounds defined by the mask, allowing for more precise control over the conditioning effects. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `positive_i`: Specifies a set of positive conditioning data to be masked and combined. The strength of the mask applied affects how prominently these features will be represented. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative_i`: Specifies a set of negative conditioning data to be masked and combined. The strength of the mask applied affects how these features will be suppressed. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `mask_i`: The mask to be applied to the set of conditioning data, determining the areas of influence. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `combined_positive`: The combined set of positive conditioning data after mask application, ready for use in further generative processes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `combined_negative`: The combined set of negative conditioning data after mask application, indicating suppressed features for generative models. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
