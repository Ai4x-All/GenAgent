- `IPAdapterAdvanced`: The IPAdapterAdvanced node represents an enhanced version of the IPAdapter, designed to apply intricate image processing adaptations. It extends the basic functionalities with advanced features for more complex and refined image manipulation tasks, catering to specialized requirements in image processing workflows.
    - Parameters:
        - `weight`: Determines the overall intensity or influence of the IPAdapterAdvanced's effects on the image, providing a means to adjust the strength of the adaptations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weight_type`: Defines the method or strategy for applying weights during the image processing, influencing how adaptations are integrated. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `combine_embeds`: Specifies the technique for combining multiple embeddings, affecting the final image adaptation outcome. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_at`: Defines the starting point (as a fraction of the total process) for applying the IPAdapterAdvanced's effects, allowing for phased or gradual application. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_at`: Specifies the ending point (as a fraction of the total process) for the IPAdapterAdvanced's effects, enabling precise control over the extent of application. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `embeds_scaling`: Determines how embeddings are scaled, impacting the adaptation process and the final image quality. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model parameter specifies the underlying model to which the IPAdapterAdvanced will apply its adaptations, serving as the foundation for the image processing tasks. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `ipadapter`: This parameter represents the specific IPAdapterAdvanced instance being applied, encapsulating the advanced image processing logic and configurations. Type should be `IPADAPTER`.
        - `image`: Specifies the input image to be processed, serving as the primary subject for the adaptations applied by the IPAdapterAdvanced. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_negative`: An optional input image that serves as a negative influence or counterbalance to the primary image, used in certain adaptation strategies. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `attn_mask`: An optional attention mask that can be applied to focus or restrict the adaptations to specific areas of the image. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `clip_vision`: An optional parameter that integrates CLIP vision features into the adaptation process, enhancing the contextual relevance of the adaptations. Type should be `CLIP_VISION`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The modified model after applying the IPAdapterAdvanced's adaptations, reflecting the changes made to the image processing capabilities. Type should be `MODEL`.
