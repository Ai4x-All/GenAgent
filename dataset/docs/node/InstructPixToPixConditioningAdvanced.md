- `InstructPixToPixConditioningAdvanced`: This node is designed for advanced conditioning in the context of Pix2Pix image translation tasks. It takes in positive and negative conditioning inputs, along with new and original latent representations, to produce modified conditioning and latent outputs. The node aims to facilitate complex image manipulation tasks by allowing for the integration of additional latent information into the conditioning process.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `positive`: Represents the positive conditioning input, which is used to guide the image translation process in a desired direction. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Represents the negative conditioning input, which is used to guide the image translation away from undesired characteristics. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `new`: Represents the new latent representation to be integrated into the conditioning process. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `original`: Represents the original latent representation that is compared with the new one for shape consistency and integrated into the conditioning. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `cond1`: Modified positive conditioning output. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `cond2`: Modified negative conditioning output. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Unmodified negative conditioning input, passed through for consistency. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent`: The new latent representation with samples integrated into the conditioning outputs. Type should be `LATENT`.
