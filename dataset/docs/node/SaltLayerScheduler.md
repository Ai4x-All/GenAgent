- `SaltLayerScheduler`: The SaltLayerScheduler node is designed for scheduling parallax motion effects in audio-visual presentations, enabling dynamic camera movements that enhance the depth and immersion of the visual experience.
    - Parameters:
        - `frame_count`: Specifies the total number of frames for the animation, setting the duration of the parallax motion effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `zoom_speed`: Controls the speed of zooming in or out, affecting the perceived depth of the parallax effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pan_speed`: Determines the speed of panning, influencing the lateral movement in the parallax motion. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pan_directions`: Defines the directions for panning, allowing for varied lateral movement patterns. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `direction_change_frames`: Indicates the frames at which the direction of panning changes, adding dynamism to the motion. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `tremor_scale`: Sets the scale of the 'tremor' effect, adding a subtle shake to the parallax motion for realism. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `tremor_octaves`: Determines the number of octaves for the tremor effect, influencing its complexity and texture. Type should be `INT`.
        - `tremor_persistence`: Controls the persistence of the tremor effect, affecting its amplitude over time. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `tremor_lacunarity`: Adjusts the lacunarity of the tremor effect, impacting the frequency of the tremor's variations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `direction_curve`: Specifies the easing function for direction changes, smoothing the transitions between panning directions. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_x`: Sets the starting X position for the camera, determining its initial horizontal placement. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_y`: Sets the starting Y position for the camera, determining its initial vertical placement. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `zoom_mode`: Chooses the mode of zooming (in, out, or both), defining the zoom behavior throughout the animation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `layer_offsets`: Defines the offsets for different layers, contributing to the layered depth effect in the parallax motion. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `schedule_list`: A list representing the scheduled parallax motion effects, including zoom, pan, and tremor adjustments for each frame. Type should be `LIST`.
