- `DetailerForEachPipeForAnimateDiff`: This node is designed to apply detailed processing for each pipe within the context of animating differences, focusing on enhancing or modifying the animation output by iterating through each pipe segment. It aims to refine the animation process by applying specific detail enhancements tailored to the animation's requirements.
    - Parameters:
        - `guide_size`: Specifies the size used for guiding the detailing process, affecting how details are scaled and applied across the animation frames. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `guide_size_for`: A boolean flag that determines whether the guide size is applied based on bounding boxes or crop regions, influencing the detailing scope. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `max_size`: Defines the maximum size limit for the detailing process, ensuring that the enhancements stay within computational bounds. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `seed`: The seed value for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility and consistency in the detailing outcomes. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Determines the number of steps or iterations for the detailing process, directly impacting the depth of detailing applied. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Configuration parameter affecting the detailing algorithm's behavior, allowing for fine-tuning of the process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Specifies the sampler to be used in the detailing process, influencing the algorithm's approach to detail generation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: The scheduler parameter controls the progression of steps in the detailing process, affecting how details evolve over time. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: A parameter to adjust the level of denoising applied during detailing, balancing detail clarity with noise reduction. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `feather`: Controls the feathering of edges in detailed segments, smoothing transitions for a more cohesive visual output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `refiner_ratio`: Optional parameter to adjust the ratio of refinement applied, allowing for customization of the detailing intensity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image_frames`: The 'image_frames' input represents the sequence of images to be processed, serving as the foundation for animation detailing and enhancement. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `segs`: The 'segs' input specifies segmentation information, crucial for identifying and isolating different elements within the images for targeted detailing. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `basic_pipe`: The basic processing pipeline to be used as a reference or starting point for the detailing process. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
        - `detailer_hook`: unknown Type should be `DETAILER_HOOK`.
        - `refiner_basic_pipe_opt`: unknown Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
    - Outputs:
