- `MarigoldDepthEstimationVideo`: The MarigoldDepthEstimationVideo node is designed for diffusion-based monocular depth estimation in video sequences, incorporating optical flow for enhanced frame-to-frame consistency. It leverages experimental techniques to ensemble multiple iterations into a single depth map, optimizing for accuracy and processing efficiency. This node is particularly useful for applications requiring depth perception in dynamic scenes, offering a blend of precision and temporal stability.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: A seed value to ensure reproducibility of results across runs. It influences the initialization of random elements within the depth estimation process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `first_frame_denoise_steps`: Specifies the number of denoising steps for the first frame in a video sequence, balancing between accuracy and processing time. Type should be `INT`.
        - `first_frame_n_repeat`: The number of iterations to be ensembled for the first frame's depth map, affecting the final depth estimation's accuracy and detail. Type should be `INT`.
        - `n_repeat_batch_size`: Determines how many of the n_repeat iterations are processed together as a batch, influencing processing speed and VRAM usage. Type should be `INT`.
        - `invert`: A boolean flag to invert the depth map's color scheme, where typically black represents the front and white the back. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `keep_model_loaded`: Indicates whether to keep the depth estimation model loaded in memory between invocations, affecting initialization time and memory usage. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `scheduler`: The scheduler type to use for controlling the denoising process, affecting the characteristics of the depth map generated. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `normalize`: Whether to normalize the depth map values, ensuring they fall within a specific range for consistency. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `denoise_steps`: The number of denoising steps for each depth map, a key factor in balancing between accuracy and processing time. Type should be `INT`.
        - `flow_warping`: Enables or disables the use of optical flow for warping depth maps between frames, crucial for maintaining temporal consistency in videos. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `flow_depth_mix`: The mixing ratio between the current and previous depth maps, influenced by optical flow, to achieve temporal stability. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `noise_ratio`: The ratio of noise to signal in the initial depth map, affecting the starting point for depth estimation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `dtype`: The data type for processing (e.g., fp16, fp32), affecting memory usage and potentially the quality of results. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `model`: Specifies the model variant to use for depth estimation, such as the standard Marigold or its LCM version, affecting the depth map's characteristics. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image for which the depth estimation is to be performed. This image serves as the basis for generating depth maps, playing a crucial role in the node's operation by providing the visual data necessary for depth analysis. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `ensembled_image`: The output ensembled depth map image, representing the estimated depth of the scene. This image is the result of processing and ensembling multiple depth estimations for enhanced accuracy and visual quality. Type should be `IMAGE`.
