- `IPAdapterTiled`: The IPAdapterTiled node is designed to apply image processing adaptations in a tiled manner, enabling the handling of larger images by processing them in segments. This approach allows for detailed and scalable image modifications, leveraging the capabilities of IP adapters to enhance or alter images with precision.
    - Parameters:
        - `weight`: A floating-point value that adjusts the intensity of the applied adaptation, allowing for fine-tuning of the effect on the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weight_type`: Specifies the method of weight application, influencing how the adaptation's intensity is modulated across the image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `combine_embeds`: Specifies the method for combining embeddings, offering various strategies to integrate or differentiate image features during the adaptation process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_at`: A floating-point value indicating the starting point of the adaptation effect, enabling phased application over the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_at`: A floating-point value marking the end point of the adaptation effect, allowing for controlled application across the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sharpening`: Adjusts the sharpness of the adapted image, enhancing detail clarity as part of the image processing. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `embeds_scaling`: Determines the scaling approach for embeddings, affecting the adaptation's influence based on different scaling strategies. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: Specifies the model to be used for image processing, serving as the core computational element in the adaptation process. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `ipadapter`: Defines the IP adapter to be applied, determining the specific image processing technique or enhancement to be utilized. Type should be `IPADAPTER`.
        - `image`: The input image to be processed, which will be adapted in a tiled manner according to the specified IP adapter. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_negative`: An optional negative image input that can be used for contrastive adaptations, enhancing specific features by comparison. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `attn_mask`: An optional attention mask that can be applied to focus the adaptation on specific areas of the image, enhancing or preserving detail selectively. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `clip_vision`: An optional CLIP vision model input that can be used to guide the adaptation process based on semantic understanding of the image content. Type should be `CLIP_VISION`.
    - Outputs:
        - `MODEL`: The modified model after applying the tiled image processing adaptations. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `tiles`: The processed image segments, which have been adapted and are ready for further processing or analysis. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `masks`: Attention masks corresponding to each tile, indicating areas of focus or preservation during the adaptation process. Type should be `MASK`.
