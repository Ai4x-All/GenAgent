- `Conditioning Grid (string)`: This node automates the process of generating conditioning for a grid layout by encoding text inputs using a ClipTextEncode node. Each text input is transformed into a conditioning that is then applied to the grid's AreaConditioners, streamlining the creation of conditioned grids for generative tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `base`: A base text input that serves as the foundational conditioning for the grid. This input is encoded and used as a starting point for further conditioning. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `columns`: The number of columns in the grid. This determines the grid's horizontal dimension and affects how text inputs are organized and conditioned. Type should be `INT`.
        - `rows`: The number of rows in the grid. This determines the grid's vertical dimension and affects how text inputs are organized and conditioned. Type should be `INT`.
        - `width`: The width of each cell in the grid, in pixels. This affects the spatial resolution of the conditioning applied to each grid cell. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The height of each cell in the grid, in pixels. This affects the spatial resolution of the conditioning applied to each grid cell. Type should be `INT`.
        - `strength`: The strength of the conditioning applied to the grid. This parameter influences the intensity of the conditioning effect on the generated content. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip`: The CLIP model used for encoding the text inputs into conditionings. It plays a crucial role in interpreting the text and converting it into a format that can be utilized for conditioning. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: The resulting conditioning for the grid, ready to be used in generative tasks. It encapsulates the encoded text inputs applied to the grid's layout. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
