- `MakeBasicPipe __Inspire`: The MakeBasicPipe __Inspire node is designed to construct a foundational pipeline for creative content generation, integrating various components such as models, encoders, and custom processing logic. It facilitates the seamless combination of text inputs with model-driven transformations, aiming to enhance the creative output through specialized encoding and adaptation techniques.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: The name of the checkpoint to load for the model, defining the starting point for content generation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `ckpt_key_opt`: Optional key to specify a particular configuration or variant within the checkpoint, allowing for more tailored content generation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `positive_wildcard_text`: Text input for positive prompts, intended to guide the content generation towards specific themes or concepts. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `negative_wildcard_text`: Text input for negative prompts, intended to steer the content generation away from certain themes or concepts. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `Add selection to`: Determines whether the selection is added to the positive or negative prompts, influencing the direction of content generation. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `Select to add LoRA`: Allows selection of a LoRA to add to the text, enhancing the content generation process with additional layers of refinement. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `Select to add Wildcard`: Enables the selection of a wildcard to be added to the text, introducing specific variables or elements into the content generation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `wildcard_mode`: Specifies whether the wildcard text is populated dynamically or fixed, affecting how the prompts are generated and used. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `positive_populated_text`: Specifies the text input intended to have a positive influence on the content generation process, affecting the direction and nature of the generated output. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `negative_populated_text`: Specifies the text input intended to have a negative influence, guiding the content generation away from certain themes or concepts. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `token_normalization`: Indicates whether and how tokens should be normalized during processing, impacting the encoding and subsequent model interactions. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `weight_interpretation`: Determines how weights are interpreted in the encoding process, influencing the handling of text inputs. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `stop_at_clip_layer`: Specifies the layer of the CLIP model at which processing should stop, affecting the depth of analysis and modification. Type should be `INT`.
        - `seed`: A seed value for initializing random processes, ensuring reproducibility or variability in the content generation. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `vae_opt`: Optional parameter to specify a variational autoencoder option, enabling further customization of the content generation process. Type should be `VAE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `basic_pipe`: The constructed foundational pipeline, ready for use in generating creative content based on the specified inputs and configurations. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
        - `cache_key`: A unique key associated with the generated pipeline's configuration, facilitating caching and retrieval of the pipeline for future use. Type should be `STRING`.
