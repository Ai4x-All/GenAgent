- `ImageDrawLine`: The ImageDrawLine node is designed to draw lines on images. It leverages the dimensions and color specifications provided to render a line between two points on an image, supporting customization through parameters like line thickness, color, and anti-aliasing settings.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: Specifies the width of the image canvas, essential for determining the drawing area for the line. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Specifies the height of the image canvas, essential for determining the drawing area for the line. Type should be `INT`.
        - `size`: Specifies the thickness of the line to be drawn, playing a significant role in the visual impact of the line on the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_x`: The starting x-coordinate for the line, marking one end of the line on the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_y`: The starting y-coordinate for the line, working together with start_x to define the initial point of the line. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_x`: The ending x-coordinate for the line, marking the other end of the line on the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_y`: The ending y-coordinate for the line, working together with end_x to define the terminal point of the line. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `red`: The red color component of the line, contributing to the final color of the line drawn on the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `green`: The green color component of the line, contributing to the final color of the line drawn on the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blue`: The blue color component of the line, contributing to the final color of the line drawn on the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha`: The alpha (transparency) component of the line's color, allowing for transparency effects in the line drawn on the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `SSAA`: Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing factor for the line, enhancing the visual quality of the line by reducing jagged edges. Type should be `INT`.
        - `method`: The method used for resizing the image after drawing the line, affecting the final appearance of the line. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The modified image with the line drawn on it, returned as a tensor. Type should be `IMAGE`.
