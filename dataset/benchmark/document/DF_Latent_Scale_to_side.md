- `DF_Latent_Scale_to_side`: This node is designed to upscale or modify the dimensions of a latent representation based on a specified side length and side (Width, Height, Longest, Shortest). It adjusts the latent's dimensions while maintaining its aspect ratio, using various scaling methods and optional cropping.
    - Inputs:
        - `latent` (Required): The latent representation to be scaled. It is the core input that undergoes transformation based on the specified parameters. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `side_length` (Required): Specifies the target length for the chosen side (Width, Height, Longest, Shortest) of the latent, dictating the scale to which the latent will be adjusted. Type should be `INT`.
        - `side` (Required): Determines which side of the latent (Width, Height, Longest, Shortest) the side_length applies to, guiding the scaling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scale_method` (Required): The method used for scaling the latent's dimensions. It affects the quality and characteristics of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `crop` (Required): Optional parameter that specifies if and how the scaled latent should be cropped, affecting the final output's dimensions. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The scaled latent representation, adjusted according to the specified side length, side, scale method, and cropping option. Type should be `LATENT`.
