- `DeepDanbooruCaption`: The DeepDanbooruCaption node is designed to generate captions for images using the DeepDanbooru model. It processes images to identify and describe their content with tags, optionally applying a prefix and suffix to each caption, and can be configured to filter tags, adjust thresholds, and sort tags alphabetically.
    - Parameters:
        - `threshold`: The confidence threshold for including tags in the caption. Tags with confidence below this threshold are excluded. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sort_alpha`: Determines whether the tags should be sorted alphabetically in the caption. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `use_spaces`: Controls whether spaces should be used between tags in the caption. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `escape`: Indicates whether special characters in tags should be escaped. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `filter_tags`: A list of tags to be excluded from the captions. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `device_mode`: Specifies the device mode (e.g., CPU, GPU, AUTO) for running the DeepDanbooru model. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `prefix`: A prefix to be added before each caption. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `suffix`: A suffix to be added after each caption. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `enabled`: Enables or disables the captioning functionality. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The image to be captioned. It is the primary input for generating captions. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `caption`: The generated captions for the input image, potentially modified by prefix and suffix. Type should be `STRING`.
