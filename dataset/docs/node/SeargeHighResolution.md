- `SeargeHighResolution`: The SeargeHighResolution node is designed to enhance the resolution and detail of images through a series of upscale and detail enhancement processes. It leverages various scaling techniques, including bicubic and nearest neighbor interpolations, and integrates with model-based upscaling and detail enhancement to achieve high-resolution outputs. This node plays a crucial role in refining image quality, especially in scenarios where higher detail and clarity are desired.
    - Parameters:
        - `hires_mode`: Specifies the high-resolution mode to be used, influencing the overall approach and techniques applied for image enhancement. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `hires_scale`: Determines the scaling factor for upscaling the image, directly affecting the final image size and detail level. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `hires_denoise`: Controls the amount of denoising applied during the upscaling process, helping to reduce noise in the upscaled image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `hires_softness`: A parameter controlling the blend between different upscaling methods (nearest and bicubic) to achieve a desired softness in the image texture. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `hires_detail_boost`: Adjusts the intensity of detail enhancement applied to the upscaled image, allowing for finer control over the clarity and sharpness of details. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `hires_contrast_factor`: Modifies the contrast of the upscaled image, enhancing visual depth and definition. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `hires_saturation_factor`: Alters the saturation level of the upscaled image, affecting color intensity and vibrance. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `hires_latent_detailer`: An optional model for enhancing the details of the upscaled image at a latent level, further refining image quality. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `final_upscale_size`: Specifies the target size for the final upscaled image, determining the overall dimensions of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `data`: Optional data that can be passed through for additional processing or information tracking. Type should be `SRG_DATA_STREAM`.
    - Outputs:
        - `data`: The final upscaled and detail-enhanced image data, representing the high-resolution output of the node's processing. This data includes the upscaled image along with any additional information processed through the node. Type should be `SRG_DATA_STREAM`.
