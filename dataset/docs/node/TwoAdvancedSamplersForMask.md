- `TwoAdvancedSamplersForMask`: This node provides advanced sampling capabilities for image masks, enabling precise control over the application and manipulation of masks in image processing tasks. It leverages specialized sampling techniques to modify latent images based on mask parameters, facilitating complex image transformations.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: The seed parameter ensures reproducibility of the sampling process, allowing for consistent results across different runs. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Defines the number of steps to be taken in the advanced sampling process, affecting the granularity of the transformation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `denoise`: Controls the level of denoising applied during the sampling process, influencing the clarity and quality of the output image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `overlap_factor`: Adjusts the degree of overlap between mask applications, affecting the blending and transition between masked and unmasked areas. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `samples`: Represents the latent images to be processed, serving as the input for the advanced sampling operations. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `base_sampler`: Specifies the base sampler used for the initial phase of image transformation, setting the foundation for further mask application. Type should be `KSAMPLER_ADVANCED`.
        - `mask_sampler`: Determines the sampler used for applying the mask to the image, directly influencing the areas of the image to be modified. Type should be `KSAMPLER_ADVANCED`.
        - `mask`: The mask parameter defines the specific areas of the image to be targeted by the sampling process, enabling selective image manipulation. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: Outputs the modified latent image after the advanced sampling and mask application process. Type should be `LATENT`.
