- `RemapBarrelDistortion`: The RemapBarrelDistortion node is designed to adjust images by applying barrel distortion correction or introducing barrel distortion effects. It allows for the manipulation of image geometry to correct distortions typically caused by camera lenses or to create specific visual effects.
    - Parameters:
        - `a`: Coefficient 'a' influences the degree of distortion applied to the image, playing a crucial role in the barrel distortion correction or introduction. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `b`: Coefficient 'b' works alongside other coefficients to fine-tune the distortion effect, affecting the curvature of the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `c`: Coefficient 'c' is another parameter that adjusts the distortion effect, contributing to the overall shape and intensity of the image transformation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `use_inverse_variant`: This boolean parameter decides whether to use an alternative formula for computing the distortion, affecting the final appearance of the remapped image. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `d`: An optional coefficient 'd' that can be used to further adjust the distortion effect, providing additional control over the image transformation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `remap`: The output is a transformation map for applying the barrel distortion effect to an image, enabling the correction or introduction of distortion. Type should be `REMAP`.
