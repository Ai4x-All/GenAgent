- `ttN pipeOUT`: The ttN pipeOUT node is designed for aggregating and outputting various components of a generative pipeline, including models, conditioning data, latent representations, and generated images. It serves as a final step in a pipeline, consolidating outputs for further processing or visualization.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: The 'pipe' parameter represents the pipeline state, encapsulating all relevant data including models, conditioning inputs, and generated outputs. It is crucial for the node's operation as it determines the content and structure of the output. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The model used in the pipeline. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `pos`: Positive conditioning data. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `neg`: Negative conditioning data. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent`: Latent representations generated by the pipeline. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `vae`: VAE model used in the pipeline. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `clip`: CLIP model used in the pipeline. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `image`: Generated images. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `seed`: Seed used for random number generation in the pipeline. Type should be `INT`.
        - `pipe`: The entire pipeline state, encapsulating all inputs and outputs. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
