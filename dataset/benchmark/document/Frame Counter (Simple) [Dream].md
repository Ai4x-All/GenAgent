- `Frame Counter (Simple) [Dream]`: This node generates a frame counter based on the specified frame index, total number of frames, and frames per second. It is designed to facilitate animation processes by tracking and managing frame progression.
    - Inputs:
        - `frame_index` (Required): Specifies the current frame index. It is crucial for determining the starting point of the frame counter. Type should be `INT`.
        - `total_frames` (Required): Defines the total number of frames in the animation sequence. It sets the upper limit for the frame counter. Type should be `INT`.
        - `frames_per_second` (Required): Determines the frame rate by specifying the number of frames to be played per second. This affects the timing and speed of the animation. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `frame_counter`: Outputs a FrameCounter object initialized with the current frame, total frames, and frames per second, facilitating further animation control. Type should be `FRAME_COUNTER`.
