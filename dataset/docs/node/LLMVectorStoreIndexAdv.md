- `LLMVectorStoreIndexAdv`: The LLMVectorStoreIndexAdv node is designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of vector storage and indexing operations within large language models. It focuses on advanced techniques for managing vector data, aiming to optimize retrieval and storage processes in a scalable manner.
    - Parameters:
        - `chunk_size`: Defines the size of text chunks for processing, affecting how documents are split and indexed. Type should be `COMBO[INT]`.
        - `chunk_overlap`: Specifies the overlap between consecutive text chunks, influencing the continuity and coverage of the indexing process. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `llm_model`: Specifies the large language model used for embedding generation, playing a crucial role in the indexing process by determining the vector representations of text. Type should be `LLM_MODEL`.
        - `document`: The input document(s) to be indexed, where each document's text and optional metadata are processed and transformed into vector embeddings. Type should be `DOCUMENT`.
        - `optional_llm_context`: An optional context parameter that allows for customization of the indexing process based on specific requirements or configurations of the large language model. Type should be `LLM_CONTEXT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `llm_index`: The output is an index object that facilitates efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings, representing the processed documents. Type should be `LLM_INDEX`.
