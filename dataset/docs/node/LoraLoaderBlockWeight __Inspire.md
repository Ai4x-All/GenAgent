- `LoraLoaderBlockWeight __Inspire`: The LoraLoaderBlockWeight node is designed to dynamically load and apply LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adjustments to models and clips based on specified parameters. It enhances or modifies the behavior of models and clips by applying LoRA adjustments, which are determined by the strength and other parameters provided, to achieve desired effects or performance improvements.
    - Parameters:
        - `category_filter`: Optional parameter that allows filtering the LoRA adjustments based on specified categories, enabling more targeted adaptations. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lora_name`: This parameter specifies the name of the LoRA file to be loaded and applied, serving as a key identifier for selecting the appropriate LoRA adjustments. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `strength_model`: Defines the intensity of the LoRA adjustment to be applied to the model, allowing for fine-tuned control over the adaptation's impact. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `strength_clip`: Determines the strength of the LoRA adjustment for the clip model, enabling precise modulation of the adaptation effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `inverse`: A boolean flag that, when set, inverses the LoRA adjustment effect, offering an alternative mode of adaptation. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `seed`: The seed parameter is used to ensure reproducibility in the LoRA adjustment process by initializing random elements in a consistent manner. Type should be `INT`.
        - `A`: Parameter A is part of the LoRA adjustment calculation, contributing to the customization of the adaptation effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `B`: Parameter B works alongside A in the LoRA adjustment formula, further tailoring the adaptation's outcome. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `preset`: A preset configuration for the LoRA adjustment process, potentially simplifying the setup for common use cases or desired outcomes. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `block_vector`: This parameter represents a vector used in the LoRA adjustment process, potentially influencing the direction and magnitude of the adaptation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `bypass`: When set to true, bypasses the LoRA adjustment process entirely, allowing the original models to pass through unchanged. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model parameter represents the base model to which LoRA adjustments will be applied. It is crucial for defining the starting point of the adaptation process. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The clip parameter signifies the clip model that will undergo LoRA adjustments alongside the base model, allowing for synchronized modifications across both models. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The adapted model with LoRA adjustments applied, reflecting the specified strength and other parameters. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The clip model after undergoing LoRA adjustments, showcasing the effects of the specified adaptation parameters. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `populated_vector`: A vector populated during the LoRA adjustment process, potentially containing information relevant to the adaptation's specifics. Type should be `STRING`.
