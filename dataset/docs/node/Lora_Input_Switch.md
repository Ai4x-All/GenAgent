- `Lora Input Switch`: The WAS_Lora_Input_Switch node is designed to selectively switch between two sets of model and CLIP inputs based on a boolean condition. It facilitates dynamic input selection for further processing or model application.
    - Parameters:
        - `boolean`: A boolean condition that determines which set of inputs (model_a and clip_a or model_b and clip_b) is selected. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model_a`: The first model input option. This model is selected if the boolean condition is true. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip_a`: The first CLIP input option. This CLIP is selected if the boolean condition is true. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `model_b`: The second model input option. This model is selected if the boolean condition is false. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip_b`: The second CLIP input option. This CLIP is selected if the boolean condition is false. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The selected model based on the boolean condition. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The selected CLIP based on the boolean condition. Type should be `CLIP`.
