- `RebatchLatents`: The RebatchLatents node is designed to reorganize a batch of latent representations into a new batch configuration, based on a specified batch size. It ensures that the latent samples are grouped appropriately, handling variations in dimensions and sizes, to facilitate further processing or model inference.
    - Parameters:
        - `batch_size`: The 'batch_size' parameter specifies the desired number of samples per batch in the output. It directly influences the grouping and division of the input latents into new batches. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `latents`: The 'latents' parameter represents the input latent representations to be rebatched. It is crucial for determining the structure and content of the output batch. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The output is a reorganized batch of latent representations, adjusted according to the specified batch size. It facilitates further processing or analysis. Type should be `LATENT`.
