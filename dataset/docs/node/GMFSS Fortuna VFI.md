- `GMFSS Fortuna VFI`: GMFSS Fortuna VFI is a frame interpolation node designed to generate intermediate frames between two given images using a deep learning model. It leverages the GMFSS Fortuna architecture to predict and synthesize high-quality intermediate frames, enhancing video fluidity and realism.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: The checkpoint name for the model used in frame interpolation. It specifies the pre-trained model to be loaded for generating intermediate frames. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clear_cache_after_n_frames`: An integer specifying how often to clear the CUDA cache to prevent memory overflow during processing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `multiplier`: An integer indicating the number of intermediate frames to generate between each pair of input frames, effectively controlling the frame rate increase. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `frames`: A tensor containing the sequence of frames for which intermediate frames are to be generated. It serves as the input sequence for the interpolation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `optional_interpolation_states`: An optional parameter providing state information for selective frame interpolation, allowing for more control over which frames are interpolated. Type should be `INTERPOLATION_STATES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output tensor containing the interpolated frames, enhancing the fluidity and realism of the input video sequence. Type should be `IMAGE`.
