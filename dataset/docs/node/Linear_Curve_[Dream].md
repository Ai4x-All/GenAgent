- `Linear Curve [Dream]`: The Linear Curve node provides a linear interpolation between an initial and a final value over a sequence of frames, typically used to create smooth transitions or animations.
    - Parameters:
        - `initial_value`: Specifies the starting value of the linear interpolation, serving as the base for the animation or transition. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `final_value`: Defines the end value of the linear interpolation, determining the target of the animation or transition. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `frame_counter`: Tracks the progression of frames, dictating the current position in the interpolation process. Type should be `FRAME_COUNTER`.
    - Outputs:
        - `FLOAT`: The interpolated float value at the current frame, reflecting the linear progression. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `INT`: The interpolated value rounded to the nearest integer, providing a discrete step in the progression. Type should be `INT`.
