- `MonoMerge`: The MonoMerge node is designed for merging two images into a monochromatic image based on a target color scheme (either towards white or black). This process involves comparing the luminance of corresponding pixels from both images and selecting the one that aligns with the target color scheme, thereby creating a new image that emphasizes either the lighter or darker aspects of the combined images.
    - Parameters:
        - `target`: Specifies the target color scheme for the merge, either 'white' or 'black'. This determines whether the merge emphasizes lighter or darker aspects of the images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `output_format`: Defines the output format of the merged image, allowing for flexibility in how the result is utilized or displayed. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image1`: The first image to be merged. It plays a crucial role in the merging process as its pixels are compared with those of the second image to determine the final image based on the target color scheme. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image2`: The second image to be merged. It is equally important as the first image, as its pixels are compared with those of the first image to create the final monochromatic image according to the target color scheme. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is a monochromatic image that combines elements of the input images according to the specified target color scheme, either emphasizing lighter or darker tones. Type should be `IMAGE`.
