- `GrowMaskWithBlur`: The GrowMaskWithBlur node is designed to manipulate masks or batches of masks by expanding or contracting them, optionally applying blur, and performing various other transformations such as flipping, filling holes, and interpolating between frames. This node is versatile in mask processing, allowing for dynamic adjustments and enhancements to mask data.
    - Parameters:
        - `expand`: Determines the amount by which the mask(s) will be expanded or contracted. Positive values expand the mask, while negative values contract it. Type should be `INT`.
        - `incremental_expandrate`: Specifies the rate at which the expand parameter is adjusted per frame, allowing for dynamic resizing over a sequence of masks. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `tapered_corners`: When enabled, applies tapered corners to the mask(s) during expansion or contraction, affecting the shape of the processed mask. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `flip_input`: If set to true, flips the input mask(s) horizontally before any other processing is done. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `blur_radius`: Applies a blur effect to the mask(s) with the specified radius. A value greater than 0 activates this effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `lerp_alpha`: The alpha value used for linear interpolation between frames, enabling smooth transitions in animated mask sequences. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `decay_factor`: A decay factor applied to the mask(s) over frames, allowing for gradual fading or intensification of features. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `fill_holes`: When enabled, fills any holes in the mask(s), which can be particularly useful for creating more solid or coherent mask shapes. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `mask`: The input mask or batch of masks to be processed. It serves as the primary data upon which all transformations are applied. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The primary output mask after applying the specified transformations. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask_inverted`: The inverted version of the primary output mask, providing an alternative visualization or application. Type should be `MASK`.
