- `DrawInstanceDiffusionTracking`: This node is designed for visualizing tracking data on images by drawing bounding boxes and optionally text annotations. It leverages tracking information generated by the CreateInstanceDiffusionTracking node to overlay visual cues on images, enhancing the interpretability of tracking data.
    - Inputs:
        - `image` (Required): The image on which tracking data will be visualized. It serves as the canvas for drawing bounding boxes and text annotations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `tracking` (Required): Tracking data containing information about detected objects, used to draw bounding boxes and text annotations on the image. Type should be `TRACKING`.
        - `box_line_width` (Required): Specifies the thickness of the bounding boxes drawn around detected objects. Type should be `INT`.
        - `draw_text` (Required): A boolean flag indicating whether to draw text annotations (class name and ID) above the bounding boxes. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `font` (Required): The font used for text annotations, allowing customization of the visual appearance of text. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `font_size` (Required): The size of the font used for text annotations, affecting the readability of text above bounding boxes. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The image with tracking data visualized through bounding boxes and optional text annotations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
