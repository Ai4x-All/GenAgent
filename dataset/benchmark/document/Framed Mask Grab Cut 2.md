- `Framed Mask Grab Cut 2`: This node applies the GrabCut algorithm with an enhanced framing mechanism to segment the foreground from the background in images. It allows for more precise control over the segmentation process by incorporating options to ignore certain areas as probable background, thereby improving the accuracy of the mask generated.
    - Inputs:
        - `image` (Required): The input image on which the GrabCut algorithm will be applied. This parameter is crucial for defining the area of interest for foreground segmentation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `thresh_maybe` (Required): Threshold values to identify probable foreground regions. This helps in refining the segmentation process by distinguishing between probable foreground and other areas. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `thresh_sure` (Required): Threshold values to identify definite foreground regions. This parameter is essential for accurately segmenting the foreground from the background. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `iterations` (Required): The number of iterations the GrabCut algorithm will run. More iterations can lead to more accurate segmentation but at the cost of increased computation time. Type should be `INT`.
        - `margin` (Required): Defines the margin size around the frame to be considered as definite background, aiding in better isolation of the foreground object. Type should be `INT`.
        - `frame_option` (Required): Specifies the framing options to include or exclude certain parts of the image from being considered as background, offering flexibility in foreground segmentation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `binary_threshold` (Required): The threshold value used to differentiate between probable foreground and background based on the 'thresh_maybe' and 'thresh_sure' parameters. Type should be `INT`.
        - `maybe_black_is_sure_background` (Required): A boolean parameter that, if true, treats pixels darker than the binary threshold as definite background, further refining the segmentation. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `output_format` (Required): The desired output format of the result, which can influence how the segmented mask is utilized in subsequent processes or visualizations. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The segmented foreground mask generated by the GrabCut algorithm, highlighting the areas identified as foreground. Type should be `IMAGE`.
