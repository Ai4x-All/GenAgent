- `SaltScheduleVariance`: The SaltScheduleVariance node applies a combination of noise-based tremors and easing functions to a schedule list to create a varied output. This process enhances the dynamic range and visual interest of scheduled events or animations by introducing controlled randomness and smooth transitions.
    - Parameters:
        - `curves_mode`: Specifies the type of easing function to apply, enhancing the schedule list with smooth transitions. This parameter allows for the customization of the variance effect, tailoring the output to specific aesthetic or functional requirements. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `use_perlin_tremors`: A boolean flag that determines whether noise-based tremors are applied to the schedule list, introducing a layer of controlled randomness to the variance process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `tremor_scale`: Adjusts the intensity of the noise-based tremors applied to the schedule list, allowing for fine-tuning of the variance effect's impact. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `octaves`: Defines the number of layers of noise to combine for creating tremors, affecting the complexity and texture of the variance. Type should be `INT`.
        - `persistence`: Controls the amplitude's decrease across noise octaves, influencing the smoothness and subtlety of the tremors. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `lacunarity`: Determines the frequency increase across noise octaves, affecting the detail and scale of the tremors. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `schedule_list`: The primary list of scheduled values to be varied. It serves as the base for applying noise adjustments and easing functions, directly influencing the variance and dynamics of the output. Type should be `LIST`.
    - Outputs:
        - `schedule_list`: The resulting list after applying noise-based tremors and easing functions to the input schedule list, showcasing the enhanced variance and dynamics. Type should be `LIST`.
