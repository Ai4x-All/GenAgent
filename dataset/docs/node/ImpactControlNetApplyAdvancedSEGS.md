- `ImpactControlNetApplyAdvancedSEGS`: This node applies an advanced control network to SEGS (segmentation masks) with additional parameters for fine-tuning the application process. It allows for the dynamic adjustment of the control network's influence over the segmentation masks, enabling more precise and context-sensitive modifications.
    - Parameters:
        - `strength`: A scalar value that adjusts the intensity of the control network's effect on the segmentation masks. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_percent`: The starting percentage of the control network's effect, allowing for gradual application from a certain point. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_percent`: The ending percentage of the control network's effect, enabling the control network's influence to taper off. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `segs`: The segmentation masks to which the control network will be applied. It's crucial for defining the areas of interest for modification. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `control_net`: The control network used to modify the segmentation masks. It determines the nature of the modifications applied to the segs. Type should be `CONTROL_NET`.
        - `segs_preprocessor`: An optional preprocessor for the segmentation masks before applying the control network. It can be used for initial adjustments. Type should be `SEGS_PREPROCESSOR`.
        - `control_image`: An optional image that can be used alongside the control network to further guide the modifications applied to the segmentation masks. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `segs`: The modified segmentation masks after the application of the control network, reflecting the adjustments made. Type should be `SEGS`.
