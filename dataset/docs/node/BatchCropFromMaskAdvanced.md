- `BatchCropFromMaskAdvanced`: This node is designed for advanced cropping operations on batches of images based on their associated masks. It calculates the optimal bounding box for each mask, applies smoothing to the bounding box sizes, and adjusts the crop size dynamically to ensure consistency and precision across the batch.
    - Parameters:
        - `crop_size_mult`: A multiplier that adjusts the size of the crop dynamically, allowing for flexibility in the final crop dimensions. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `bbox_smooth_alpha`: A parameter used to smooth the changes in bounding box sizes across the batch, ensuring a more consistent crop size. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `original_images`: The batch of original images that will be cropped according to the calculated bounding boxes derived from the masks. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `masks`: A batch of masks used to determine the areas of interest for cropping the corresponding images. The masks guide the cropping process by identifying non-zero regions that signify relevant content. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `original_images`: The original batch of images provided as input, returned without modifications. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `cropped_images`: The resulting batch of images after cropping, tailored to the areas of interest defined by the masks. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `cropped_masks`: The corresponding batch of masks after cropping, aligned with the cropped images. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `combined_crop_image`: A single image created by combining the cropped areas from the original images, based on the combined bounding box. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `combined_crop_masks`: A single mask created by combining the cropped areas from the original masks, based on the combined bounding box. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `bboxes`: The list of bounding boxes calculated for each mask, used for cropping the images. Type should be `BBOX`.
        - `combined_bounding_box`: The combined bounding box calculated from all masks, used for creating the combined cropped image and mask. Type should be `BBOX`.
        - `bbox_width`: The width of the largest bounding box calculated across all masks, adjusted for consistency and precision. Type should be `INT`.
        - `bbox_height`: The height of the largest bounding box calculated across all masks, adjusted for consistency and precision. Type should be `INT`.
