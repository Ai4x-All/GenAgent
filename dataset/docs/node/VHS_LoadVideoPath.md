- `VHS_LoadVideoPath`: The VHS_LoadVideoPath node facilitates the loading of video files from specified paths for integration into a video processing workflow. It ensures the video file is accessible, validates the path, and prepares the video for subsequent processing or analysis tasks within the Video Helper Suite.
    - Parameters:
        - `video`: Specifies the path to the video file to be loaded, enabling the node to access and process the video. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `force_rate`: Determines the frame rate to be enforced on the loaded video, allowing for consistent frame rate processing across videos. Type should be `INT`.
        - `force_size`: Allows specifying a desired resolution for the video, facilitating the standardization of video sizes for processing. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `custom_width`: Sets a custom width for the video, enabling precise control over the video's dimensions. Type should be `INT`.
        - `custom_height`: Sets a custom height for the video, enabling precise control over the video's dimensions. Type should be `INT`.
        - `frame_load_cap`: Limits the number of frames to be loaded from the video, useful for processing videos within memory constraints. Type should be `INT`.
        - `skip_first_frames`: Skips a specified number of initial frames in the video, useful for starting processing at a later point in the video. Type should be `INT`.
        - `select_every_nth`: Selects every nth frame from the video for loading, allowing for sparse sampling of video frames. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `meta_batch`: Associates the loaded video with a specific batch for processing, facilitating batch operations within the Video Helper Suite. Type should be `VHS_BatchManager`.
    - Outputs:
        - `IMAGE`: The loaded video frames as images, ready for further processing. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `frame_count`: The total number of frames loaded from the video. Type should be `INT`.
        - `audio`: The audio track extracted from the video, if any. Type should be `VHS_AUDIO`.
        - `video_info`: Metadata and information about the loaded video. Type should be `VHS_VIDEOINFO`.
