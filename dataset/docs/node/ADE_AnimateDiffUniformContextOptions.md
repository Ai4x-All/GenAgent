- `ADE_AnimateDiffUniformContextOptions`: This node is designed to generate context options for the AnimateDiff process, focusing on creating a looped uniform context. It allows for the customization of context parameters such as length, stride, and overlap, and supports the configuration of looped animations with options for closed loops and fusion methods. It's aimed at enhancing the flexibility and control over the animation generation process in AnimateDiff.
    - Parameters:
        - `context_length`: Specifies the length of the context to be generated. It's crucial for defining the scope of the animation sequence and affects the overall animation process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `context_stride`: Defines the stride between each context in the sequence, affecting the smoothness and speed of the animation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `context_overlap`: Sets the amount of overlap between contexts, influencing the continuity and fluidity of the animation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `context_schedule`: Determines the scheduling method for the context, impacting the structure and timing of the animation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `closed_loop`: Indicates whether the animation should loop back to the beginning, creating a seamless loop effect. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `fuse_method`: Specifies the method for fusing contexts, affecting the blending and transition between animation frames. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `use_on_equal_length`: Determines whether to use the context options when the length of all contexts is equal, optimizing for specific animation scenarios. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `start_percent`: Determines the starting point of the animation as a percentage of the total length. This parameter allows for fine-tuning the initial phase of the animation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `guarantee_steps`: Ensures a minimum number of steps in the animation, providing a baseline for the animation's complexity and duration. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `prev_context`: Allows for the inclusion of previously defined context options, enabling the chaining and layering of animation contexts for more complex animations. Type should be `CONTEXT_OPTIONS`.
        - `view_opts`: Allows for the specification of view options, further customizing the visual aspects of the animation. Type should be `VIEW_OPTS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `CONTEXT_OPTS`: Generates a set of context options tailored for looped uniform animations in AnimateDiff, enhancing the control and customization of the animation process. Type should be `CONTEXT_OPTIONS`.
