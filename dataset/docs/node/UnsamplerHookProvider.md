- `UnsamplerHookProvider`: The UnsamplerHookProvider node is designed to create and manage UnsamplerHook instances, which are specialized hooks for adjusting the sampling process based on dynamic step calculations. This node plays a crucial role in customizing the sampling behavior, particularly in modifying the end step of the sampling process dynamically, to achieve desired effects or optimizations in image generation tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `steps`: Specifies the total number of steps to be used in the sampling process. This parameter is essential for determining the duration and granularity of the sampling operation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_end_at_step`: Defines the initial step at which the end step adjustment begins. This parameter is key to controlling when the dynamic modification of the sampling process starts. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_end_at_step`: Indicates the final step at which the end step adjustment concludes. This parameter helps in fine-tuning the end of the dynamic sampling modification period. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: The configuration setting for the sampling process. It influences the behavior of the UnsamplerHook by providing specific configuration values. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: The name of the sampler to be used. This parameter identifies which sampling algorithm the UnsamplerHook will apply during the sampling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Specifies the scheduler to be used in conjunction with the sampler. The scheduler manages the progression of steps during the sampling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `normalize`: A boolean flag indicating whether to normalize the samples during the sampling process. Normalization can affect the quality and characteristics of the generated images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `schedule_for_iteration`: Specifies the scheduling strategy for iteration within the sampling process. This parameter determines how the UnsamplerHook dynamically adjusts the sampling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model parameter represents the generative model to be used for sampling. It is crucial for defining the behavior and capabilities of the UnsamplerHook, as the hook will operate based on the characteristics and functionalities of this model. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `positive`: A parameter that influences the sampling process by adjusting the positive aspects of the generated samples. It's part of the customization options provided by the UnsamplerHook. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: A parameter that influences the sampling process by adjusting the negative aspects of the generated samples. It's part of the customization options provided by the UnsamplerHook. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pk_hook`: Returns an instance of UnsamplerHook, which is a specialized hook for dynamically adjusting the sampling process based on the provided parameters. Type should be `PK_HOOK`.
