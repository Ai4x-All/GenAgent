- `AV_ControlNetPreprocessor`: The AV_ControlNetPreprocessor node is designed for preparing images for further processing or analysis within the ControlNet framework. It allows for the application of various preprocessing techniques to images, including resolution adjustment and the selection of specific preprocessors, to optimize them for ControlNet's requirements.
    - Parameters:
        - `preprocessor`: Specifies the preprocessing technique to be applied to the input image. It can be one of several predefined preprocessors or a custom one, influencing the preprocessing outcome. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `sd_version`: Indicates the specific version of Stable Diffusion to be used, affecting how the preprocessing aligns with the model's requirements. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `resolution`: The desired resolution for the output image, which can be adjusted to meet specific quality or performance criteria. Type should be `INT`.
        - `preprocessor_override`: Allows for the override of the initially selected preprocessor with an alternative, providing flexibility in preprocessing choices. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be preprocessed. This is the primary data upon which preprocessing operations are performed. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `IMAGE`: The preprocessed image, ready for further processing or analysis within the ControlNet framework. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `CNET_NAME`: The name of the ControlNet used or identified during the preprocessing, providing context for subsequent processing steps. Type should be `STRING`.
