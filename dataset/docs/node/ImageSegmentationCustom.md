- `ImageSegmentationCustom`: This node specializes in custom image segmentation tasks, leveraging advanced configurations and models to precisely delineate and separate different elements within images. It is designed for scenarios requiring tailored segmentation approaches, offering flexibility in processing and enhancing image analysis capabilities.
    - Parameters:
        - `model`: Specifies the segmentation model to be used. This choice significantly impacts the accuracy and quality of the segmentation, allowing for customization to fit specific requirements. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `alpha_matting`: A boolean flag indicating whether alpha matting should be applied to improve the segmentation's edge quality, particularly useful for achieving more precise and refined edges. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `alpha_matting_foreground_threshold`: The threshold value for determining foreground elements in the context of alpha matting, aiding in the enhancement of segmentation accuracy around object borders. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha_matting_background_threshold`: The threshold value for identifying background elements during alpha matting, contributing to the clarity and precision of the segmented image's background areas. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha_matting_erode_size`: Defines the size of the erosion applied in alpha matting, which can help in reducing the noise around edges and improving the overall segmentation quality. Type should be `INT`.
        - `post_process_mask`: Indicates whether post-processing should be applied to the segmentation mask to refine its quality, such as smoothing edges or removing noise. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `mean`: The mean values used for normalizing the input images, playing a critical role in preparing the images for segmentation by adjusting their color properties. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `std`: The standard deviation values for image normalization, essential for adjusting the scale of pixel values to match the model's expected input distribution. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `size`: Specifies the target size to which the images will be resized before segmentation, impacting the resolution and detail level of the segmentation output. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The input images to be segmented. This parameter is crucial as it directly influences the segmentation outcome, determining the visual elements to be analyzed and separated. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The segmented images, where different elements within each image are precisely delineated and separated, ready for further analysis or processing. Type should be `IMAGE`.
