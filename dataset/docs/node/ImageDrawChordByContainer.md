- `ImageDrawChordByContainer`: This node is designed to draw a chord within a specified container image, utilizing parameters such as size, start and end coordinates, color, and drawing method to define the chord's appearance.
    - Parameters:
        - `size`: Specifies the size of the chord to be drawn within the container. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_x`: The starting x-coordinate for the chord within the container. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_y`: The starting y-coordinate for the chord within the container. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_x`: The ending x-coordinate for the chord within the container. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_y`: The ending y-coordinate for the chord within the container. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start`: The starting angle of the chord in degrees. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end`: The ending angle of the chord in degrees. Type should be `INT`.
        - `red`: The red component of the chord's color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `green`: The green component of the chord's color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blue`: The blue component of the chord's color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha`: The alpha (transparency) component of the chord's color. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `SSAA`: Specifies the Super Sampling Anti-Aliasing factor to improve the drawing's quality. Type should be `INT`.
        - `method`: The method used for drawing the chord, affecting the rendering technique. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `container`: The container image within which the chord will be drawn. It serves as the canvas for the drawing operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting image with the chord drawn within the specified container. Type should be `IMAGE`.
