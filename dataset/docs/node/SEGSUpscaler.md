- `SEGSUpscaler`: The SEGSUpscaler node is designed to upscale images by segmenting them into smaller sections, enhancing each segment individually, and then reassembling them into a single, enhanced image. This process allows for more detailed and controlled upscaling, leveraging various models and techniques to improve image quality segment by segment.
    - Parameters:
        - `rescale_factor`: A multiplier for scaling the image's dimensions during the upscaling process, affecting the final size of the output image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `resampling_method`: The method used for resampling the image during the upscaling process, influencing the texture and quality of the upscaled image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `supersample`: Indicates whether supersampling is applied to enhance the image quality by reducing aliasing effects. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `rounding_modulus`: A value used to adjust the dimensions of the upscaled image, ensuring they are multiples of this modulus. Type should be `INT`.
        - `seed`: A seed value for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the upscaling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: The number of steps to perform during the image enhancement process, affecting the detail and quality of the output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Configuration settings for the enhancement process, guiding the behavior of the models used. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: The name of the sampling method used during image enhancement, influencing the texture and details of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: The scheduler used to adjust the learning rate during the enhancement process, affecting the convergence and quality of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: A boolean indicating whether denoising is applied during the enhancement process, potentially improving the clarity of the output image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `feather`: The feathering value applied to the edges of segments, smoothing transitions between enhanced segments and the rest of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `inpaint_model`: The model used for inpainting, filling in missing or removed parts of the image during the enhancement process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `noise_mask_feather`: The feathering value applied to the noise mask, smoothing the application of noise reduction across the image. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The original image to be upscaled. It serves as the base for segmentation and subsequent enhancement of each segment. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `segs`: A collection of image segments, each with its own characteristics and metadata, used for targeted upscaling and enhancement. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `model`: The main model used in the upscaling process, central to the enhancement of each image segment. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The CLIP model used for guiding the upscaling process with textual descriptions, enhancing relevance and detail. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `vae`: The VAE model used for encoding and decoding images, crucial for the transformation and enhancement of segments. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `positive`: Textual descriptions that guide the upscaling process towards desired outcomes, enhancing positive aspects of the image. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Textual descriptions that guide the upscaling process away from undesired outcomes, mitigating negative aspects of the image. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `upscale_model_opt`: Optional configuration for the upscaling model, allowing for customization of the upscaling process. Type should be `UPSCALE_MODEL`.
        - `upscaler_hook_opt`: Optional hooks for custom operations post-upscaling, allowing for additional processing or adjustments to the upscaled image. Type should be `UPSCALER_HOOK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The final, enhanced and upscaled image, combining all processed segments into a single, high-quality output. Type should be `IMAGE`.
