- `MathExpressionÔÅºpysssss`: The MathExpression node allows for the evaluation of mathematical expressions, including basic arithmetic, function calls, and variable references. It supports a dynamic and flexible approach to math operations, enabling users to input expressions that can include predefined variables and utilize a variety of mathematical functions.
    - Parameters:
        - `expression`: The mathematical expression to be evaluated. Supports arithmetic operations, function calls, and variable references. Its flexibility allows for dynamic computation based on the input. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `a`: An optional variable that can be referenced within the expression. Supports integers, floats, images, and latent types, adding versatility to the mathematical operations. Type should be `INT,FLOAT,IMAGE,LATENT`.
        - `b`: An optional variable similar to 'a', providing an additional reference point within the expression for more complex calculations. Type should be `INT,FLOAT,IMAGE,LATENT`.
        - `c`: An optional variable that serves as yet another reference within the expression, further expanding the computational possibilities. Type should be `INT,FLOAT,IMAGE,LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `int`: unknown Type should be `INT`.
        - `float`: unknown Type should be `FLOAT`.
