- `SaltAudioCompressor`: The SaltAudioCompressor node is designed to dynamically reduce the dynamic range of audio signals. It applies compression to make louder sounds quieter and quieter sounds louder, achieving a more consistent overall level.
    - Parameters:
        - `threshold_dB`: The threshold level in decibels. Sounds above this level will be compressed. It determines the point at which compression starts, impacting the loudness of the audio. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `ratio`: The compression ratio, indicating how much the audio that exceeds the threshold will be compressed. It affects the intensity of the compression applied to the audio. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attack_ms`: The attack time in milliseconds. It specifies how quickly the compressor starts to work after the audio exceeds the threshold, affecting the responsiveness of the compression. Type should be `INT`.
        - `release_ms`: The release time in milliseconds. It defines how quickly the compressor stops affecting the audio after it falls below the threshold, influencing the smoothness of the audio output. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `audio`: The raw audio data to be compressed. This input is crucial for the compression process, affecting the final output by adjusting the dynamic range of the audio. Type should be `AUDIO`.
    - Outputs:
        - `audio`: The compressed audio data, with reduced dynamic range. This output is the direct result of the compression process applied to the input audio. Type should be `AUDIO`.
