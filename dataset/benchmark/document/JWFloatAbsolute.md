- `JWFloatAbsolute`: The JWFloatAbsolute node calculates the absolute value of a given float number, effectively removing any negative sign to ensure the result is non-negative.
    - Inputs:
        - `value` (Required): The input float number whose absolute value is to be calculated. This parameter allows the node to handle both positive and negative numbers by converting them to their non-negative counterpart. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `float`: The non-negative absolute value of the input float number. Type should be `FLOAT`.
