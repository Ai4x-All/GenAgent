- `ConditioningSetMaskAndCombine4`: This node is designed to apply a series of masks to conditioning data, combining them based on specified strengths and areas. It allows for the dynamic adjustment of conditioning areas through masks, enabling precise control over the conditioning process in a multi-step or complex conditioning scenario.
    - Inputs:
        - `positive_i` (Required): Specifies the positive conditioning data to be combined with the corresponding mask. The strength and area of application are adjustable, allowing for nuanced conditioning effects. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative_i` (Required): Specifies the negative conditioning data to be combined with the corresponding mask, allowing for the subtraction or negation of conditioning effects based on the mask's application. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `mask_i` (Required): The mask to be applied to the conditioning data, defining the area and intensity of the conditioning effect. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask_i_strength` (Required): Defines the strength of the conditioning effect for the corresponding mask, influencing the intensity of the applied conditioning. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `set_cond_area` (Required): Determines whether the conditioning area is set to the bounds defined by the masks or uses a default setting, affecting how conditioning is applied. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Outputs:
        - `combined_positive`: The resulting positive conditioning data after applying the masks and combining them based on the specified parameters. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `combined_negative`: The resulting negative conditioning data, reflecting the subtractive or negating effects of the masks on the original conditioning. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
