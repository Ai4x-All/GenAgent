- `CM_ComposeVec3`: The `CM_ComposeVec3` node is designed for creating a 3-dimensional vector (Vec3) from individual float values for each of its dimensions (x, y, z). This node facilitates the conversion of separate scalar values into a structured vector format, making it essential for mathematical operations and transformations that require vector inputs.
    - Inputs:
        - `x` (Required): The 'x' parameter represents the x-coordinate of the Vec3. It is crucial for defining the vector's position along the x-axis. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `y` (Required): The 'y' parameter represents the y-coordinate of the Vec3. It plays a key role in specifying the vector's position along the y-axis. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `z` (Required): The 'z' parameter signifies the z-coordinate of the Vec3. It is essential for determining the vector's position along the z-axis. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `vec3`: The output is a 3-dimensional vector (Vec3) composed of the input float values for x, y, and z. This vector can be used for further mathematical or graphical operations. Type should be `VEC3`.
