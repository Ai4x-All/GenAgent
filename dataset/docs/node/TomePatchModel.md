- `TomePatchModel`: The TomePatchModel node is designed to modify a given model by applying a specific patching technique to its attention mechanism. This technique involves adjusting the model's attention calculations based on a provided ratio, aiming to enhance the model's performance or adapt it to specific tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `ratio`: A float value representing the ratio at which the model's attention mechanism is adjusted. This parameter influences the extent of the modification applied to the model, affecting its overall performance. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model to be patched. This parameter is crucial as it determines the base model that will undergo the patching process. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The patched model, which has undergone modifications to its attention mechanism. This output is significant as it represents the enhanced or adapted version of the original model. Type should be `MODEL`.
