- `ADE_LoopedUniformContextOptions`: This node is designed to generate looped uniform context options for animation difference (AnimateDiff) processes. It facilitates the creation of context configurations that enable seamless looping and uniform distribution of context frames, enhancing the continuity and uniformity of animations.
    - Parameters:
        - `context_length`: Specifies the total length of the context to be generated. It determines the number of frames or steps that will be included in the context, directly impacting the scope of the animation's continuity. Type should be `INT`.
        - `context_stride`: Defines the stride or step size between each context frame in the looped uniform context. It affects how densely the frames are sampled, influencing the smoothness and granularity of the animation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `context_overlap`: Determines the overlap between consecutive context frames in the looped uniform setup. This parameter helps in creating smoother transitions between frames by allowing them to share common elements. Type should be `INT`.
        - `closed_loop`: A boolean flag indicating whether the context should form a closed loop, ensuring that the animation seamlessly loops back to the beginning. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `fuse_method`: Specifies the method used to fuse multiple context frames together, affecting the blending and transition between frames in the animation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `use_on_equal_length`: A boolean flag that, when true, allows the context configuration to be applied even when the number of frames equals the context length, ensuring uniformity across all scenarios. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `start_percent`: Indicates the starting point of the animation as a percentage of the total length, allowing for precise control over the animation's initial frame. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `guarantee_steps`: Specifies the minimum number of steps or frames guaranteed to be included in the context, ensuring a baseline level of detail and continuity in the animation. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `prev_context`: An optional parameter that allows for the inclusion of previously defined context options, enabling the chaining and layering of context configurations for complex animations. Type should be `CONTEXT_OPTIONS`.
        - `view_opts`: Allows for the inclusion of view-specific options, further customizing the context configuration based on specific viewing parameters. Type should be `VIEW_OPTS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `CONTEXT_OPTS`: The generated looped uniform context options, ready to be applied to AnimateDiff processes for enhanced animation continuity and uniformity. Type should be `CONTEXT_OPTIONS`.
