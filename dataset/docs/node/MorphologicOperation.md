- `MorphologicOperation`: The MorphologicOperation node provides a comprehensive suite of morphological operations for image processing, including erosion, dilation, opening, closing, gradient, top hat, and bottom hat transformations. It is designed to apply these operations to images, allowing for various forms of structural modifications and analysis within a binary image context.
    - Parameters:
        - `operation`: Determines the specific morphological operation to be applied, such as erosion or dilation, influencing the structural transformation of the image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `kernel_type`: Specifies the shape of the kernel used in the morphological operation, affecting the nature of the transformation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `kernel_size_x`: The horizontal size of the kernel, influencing the scale and impact of the operation on the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `kernel_size_y`: The vertical size of the kernel, affecting the scale and depth of the morphological transformation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `iterations`: The number of times the morphological operation is applied, allowing for incremental structural changes. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `src`: The source image to be processed through morphological operations, enabling structural modifications based on the specified operation, kernel type, and iterations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output image after the morphological operations, reflecting the structural changes made. Type should be `IMAGE`.
