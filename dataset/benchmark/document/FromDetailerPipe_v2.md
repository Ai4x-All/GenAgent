- `FromDetailerPipe_v2`: The `FromDetailerPipe_v2` node is designed to decompose a complex detailer pipe structure into its constituent components, facilitating the extraction and individual manipulation of each component for further processing or analysis.
    - Inputs:
        - `detailer_pipe` (Required): Represents the complex structure of a detailer pipe, encapsulating various models and processing elements. It is essential for the node to dissect and provide access to individual components. Type should be `DETAILER_PIPE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `detailer_pipe`: Returns the original detailer pipe structure, allowing for potential reassembly or further reference. Type should be `DETAILER_PIPE`.
        - `model`: Extracts the primary model component from the detailer pipe. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: Retrieves the CLIP model component, used for image-text matching and manipulation. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `vae`: Extracts the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) component, crucial for image generation and manipulation. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `positive`: Provides access to the positive conditioning component, essential for guiding the generation process. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Provides access to the negative conditioning component, essential for guiding the generation process. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `bbox_detector`: Extracts the bounding box detector component, used for object detection within images. Type should be `BBOX_DETECTOR`.
        - `sam_model_opt`: Retrieves the optional SAM model component, enhancing image quality and detail. Type should be `SAM_MODEL`.
        - `segm_detector_opt`: Extracts the optional segmentation detector component, used for detailed image segmentation. Type should be `SEGM_DETECTOR`.
        - `detailer_hook`: Provides access to the detailer hook component, allowing for custom modifications and enhancements. Type should be `DETAILER_HOOK`.
