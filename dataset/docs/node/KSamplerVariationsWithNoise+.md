- `KSamplerVariationsWithNoise+`: This node is designed to generate variations of a given latent image with added noise, leveraging a two-stage sampling process. The first stage applies a composition sampler to the latent image, potentially with noise addition, to create a base variation. The second stage introduces further variations by adjusting the sampling configuration based on a variation strength parameter, aiming to produce diverse and nuanced outputs.
    - Parameters:
        - `steps`: This parameter specifies the number of steps in the sampling process, directly impacting the detail and quality of the variations produced. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: The cfg parameter adjusts the conditioning factor in the sampling process, influencing the adherence to the input conditions and the overall diversity of the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: The sampler_name parameter selects the specific sampling algorithm to be used, affecting the approach to generating variations. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: The scheduler parameter determines the scheduling algorithm for the sampling process, influencing the progression and refinement of the generated variations. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `variation_strength`: This parameter controls the degree of variation introduced in the second stage of the sampling process, allowing for fine-tuning of the output's diversity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `denoise`: The denoise parameter affects the level of noise reduction applied during the sampling process, influencing the clarity and quality of the generated variations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model parameter is crucial as it determines the underlying generative model used for the sampling process, affecting the quality and characteristics of the generated variations. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `latent_image`: The latent image serves as the starting point for the variation generation process, with its manipulation through noise and sampling defining the nature of the output. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `main_seed`: The main_seed parameter influences the initial randomness of the noise added to the latent image, thereby affecting the diversity of the generated variations. Type should be `INT:seed`.
        - `positive`: This parameter provides positive conditioning to guide the sampling towards desired characteristics or themes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: The negative conditioning parameter guides the sampling away from certain characteristics or themes, aiding in the generation of targeted variations. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `variation_seed`: The variation seed parameter introduces an additional layer of randomness to the variation generation process, enhancing the diversity of the output. Type should be `INT:seed`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The output is a modified version of the input latent image, enriched with variations and potentially noise, reflecting the combined effects of the two-stage sampling process. Type should be `LATENT`.
