- `ImageNoiseBeta`: The ImageNoiseBeta node introduces beta distribution-based noise to images, allowing for the simulation of various noise effects. This node can adjust the noise intensity and apply it selectively based on color channels, supporting both monochromatic and colored noise applications.
    - Parameters:
        - `a`: Specifies the alpha parameter of the beta distribution, influencing the shape of the noise distribution curve. Type should be `INT`.
        - `b`: Specifies the beta parameter of the beta distribution, also influencing the shape of the noise distribution curve. Type should be `INT`.
        - `monochromatic`: Determines whether the noise should be applied in a monochromatic fashion across all channels or individually per channel. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `invert`: Controls whether the noise effect should be inverted, offering a different visual effect. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `channels`: Specifies the color channels to which the noise should be applied, allowing for selective noise application. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The input images to which the beta noise will be applied. This parameter is crucial for defining the base content that will be modified. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output image with beta distribution-based noise applied, reflecting the specified intensity and channel selections. Type should be `IMAGE`.
