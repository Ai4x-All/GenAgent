- `ExtractKeyframes+`: The ExtractKeyframes node is designed to identify and extract key frames from a sequence of images based on the variation in content between consecutive frames. It utilizes a threshold to determine significant changes, thereby isolating frames that represent substantial shifts in the visual narrative.
    - Parameters:
        - `threshold`: A value that determines the sensitivity of variation detection between frames. A higher threshold results in fewer key frames being identified, focusing on more significant changes. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The sequence of images from which key frames are to be extracted. It serves as the primary input for analyzing variations between frames. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `KEYFRAMES`: The extracted key frames that represent significant changes in the sequence. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `indexes`: The indices of the extracted key frames within the original sequence, provided as a comma-separated string. Type should be `STRING`.
