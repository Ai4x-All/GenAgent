- `MaskFromColor+`: The `MaskFromColor` node generates a binary mask from an image based on specified RGB color values and a threshold. It identifies areas within the image that match the given color within the threshold range, creating a mask that highlights these regions.
    - Parameters:
        - `red`: The red component of the target color, used in conjunction with green and blue components to define the color to match in the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `green`: The green component of the target color, used together with red and blue to specify the color to match within the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blue`: The blue component of the target color, which, when combined with red and green, defines the specific color to match in the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `threshold`: The tolerance level for color matching. A higher threshold allows for a broader range of color variation to be considered a match. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image from which to generate the mask. The color within this image is compared against the specified RGB values to create the mask. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The output binary mask highlighting areas of the image that match the specified color within the given threshold. Type should be `MASK`.
