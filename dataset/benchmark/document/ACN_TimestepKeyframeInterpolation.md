        - `cn_weights` (Optional): Specifies the control network weights for the interpolation, influencing how different aspects are weighted during the transition. It enables precise control over the dynamics and balance of the transition, affecting how various elements are emphasized throughout the interpolation process. Type should be `CONTROL_NET_WEIGHTS`.
        - `latent_keyframe` (Optional): Determines the latent keyframes to be included in the interpolation, allowing for the integration of specific transformation states into the sequence. It enriches the transition with predefined keyframe data, adding depth and complexity to the interpolation by incorporating existing keyframe information. Type should be `LATENT_KEYFRAME`.
        - `null_latent_kf_strength` (Optional): Sets the strength for null latent keyframes, providing a means to adjust the influence of keyframes that do not directly contribute to the visible transformation. It allows for fine-tuning the overall effect of the interpolation, offering control over the presence and impact of latent elements in the transition. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `inherit_missing` (Optional): Indicates whether to inherit missing parameters from previous keyframes, ensuring continuity and consistency across the interpolation sequence. It helps maintain the integrity of the transition, ensuring that any gaps or missing data are seamlessly integrated for a cohesive interpolation experience. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `mask_optional` (Optional): Provides an optional mask hint for the interpolation, enabling targeted adjustments to specific regions or aspects of the animation or transformation. It offers additional control over the transition effects, allowing for localized modifications that can enhance or focus the interpolation's impact on certain areas. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `print_keyframes` (Optional): Enables logging of keyframe information for debugging or analysis purposes, offering insights into the interpolation process and the generated keyframe sequence. This feature aids in the evaluation and refinement of the interpolation, providing valuable feedback on the generated keyframes and their alignment with the intended transition. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `autosize` (Optional): Specifies the autosize configuration, adjusting the size of the control network's output to fit certain dimensions, which can be crucial for ensuring the proper scaling of animations or transformations. This parameter impacts the final output's dimensions, ensuring that the interpolated keyframes are appropriately scaled to match the desired output size. Type should be `ACNAUTOSIZE`.
