- `CreateFadeMask`: The CreateFadeMask node is designed to generate fade masks for images or sequences, allowing for smooth transitions between frames or visual elements. It utilizes parameters such as frame count, dimensions, and fade characteristics to craft customizable fade effects.
    - Parameters:
        - `invert`: A boolean flag that, when true, inverts the fade effect, offering an alternative visual transition. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `frames`: Specifies the number of frames for which the fade mask will be generated, affecting the length of the transition. Type should be `INT`.
        - `width`: Determines the width of the fade mask, directly influencing the size of the generated mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Sets the height of the fade mask, impacting the vertical dimension of the generated mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `interpolation`: Defines the method of interpolation used for the fade effect, affecting the smoothness and style of the transition. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_level`: The initial opacity level of the fade, setting the starting point of the fade effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `midpoint_level`: The opacity level at the midpoint of the fade, allowing for control over the fade's progression. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_level`: The final opacity level of the fade, determining the end point of the fade effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `midpoint_frame`: Specifies the frame at which the midpoint opacity level is reached, influencing the timing of the fade's progression. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The generated fade mask, which can be used to create smooth transitions in images or sequences. Type should be `MASK`.
