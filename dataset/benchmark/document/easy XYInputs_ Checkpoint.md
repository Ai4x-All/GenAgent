- `easy XYInputs_ Checkpoint`: This node is designed to facilitate the manipulation and visualization of checkpoint data for models, specifically focusing on generating XY input values based on checkpoint names, clip skips, and VAE names. It abstracts the complexity of handling multiple checkpoints and their associated parameters, enabling users to easily configure and visualize the impact of different checkpoints on model behavior.
    - Inputs:
        - `input_mode` (Required): Specifies the mode of input, determining how checkpoints, clip skips, and VAE names are processed and utilized within the node. It affects the node's execution path and the resulting XY values. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `ckpt_count` (Required): Defines the number of checkpoints to process, influencing the size and composition of the output XY values. It determines how many sets of checkpoint-related parameters are considered in the operation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `ckpt_name_i` (Required): Represents the name of a checkpoint. Each 'i' in 'ckpt_name_i' ranges from 1 to the total number of checkpoints specified, allowing for individual specification of multiple checkpoints. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clip_skip_i` (Required): Indicates the clip skip value for each checkpoint. Each 'i' in 'clip_skip_i' ranges from 1 to the total number of checkpoints, specifying the clip skip value associated with each checkpoint. Type should be `INT`.
        - `vae_name_i` (Required): Specifies the VAE name associated with each checkpoint. Each 'i' in 'vae_name_i' ranges from 1 to the total number of checkpoints, allowing for the association of specific VAEs with individual checkpoints. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `optional_lora_stack` (Optional): An optional parameter that, if provided, adds a LORA stack to the processing of checkpoints, clip skips, and VAE names, potentially altering the resulting XY values. Type should be `LORA_STACK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `X or Y`: The output is a set of XY values derived from the processed checkpoints, clip skips, and VAE names, intended for visualization or further analysis. Type should be `X_Y`.
