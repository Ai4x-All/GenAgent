- `ImageTransformRotate`: The ImageTransformRotate node is designed to rotate a batch of images by a specified angle. It supports optional image expansion to accommodate the rotated image fully and employs supersampling anti-aliasing (SSAA) for higher quality results. The node can handle various rotation methods, providing flexibility in image transformation tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `angle`: The angle by which the images will be rotated. This parameter determines the degree of rotation applied to each image in the batch. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `expand`: A boolean flag indicating whether the images should be expanded to fit the rotated image without clipping. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `SSAA`: Indicates the level of supersampling anti-aliasing applied to the images to improve the quality of the rotation. Higher SSAA values result in smoother edges and reduced aliasing, enhancing the visual quality of the rotated images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `method`: Specifies the method used for rotating the images, allowing for different approaches to image rotation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The batch of images to be rotated. This parameter is crucial as it specifies the input images that will undergo rotation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The rotated images, returned as a batch. This output reflects the transformed images after applying the specified rotation and any additional processing steps. Type should be `IMAGE`.
