- `SaltCyclicalSchedule`: The SaltCyclicalSchedule node is designed to generate a cyclical pattern within a given schedule list. It allows for the repetition of a specified segment of the schedule, optionally incorporating a ping-pong effect for a mirrored repetition, enhancing the dynamic range and variability of the schedule.
    - Parameters:
        - `start_index`: Specifies the starting index of the segment within the schedule list to be repeated, marking the beginning of the cyclical pattern. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_index`: Defines the ending index of the segment within the schedule list to be repeated, marking the end of the cyclical pattern. Type should be `INT`.
        - `repetitions`: Determines the number of times the specified segment is repeated, directly influencing the length and repetition rate of the cyclical schedule. Type should be `INT`.
        - `ping_pong`: When enabled, adds a mirrored repetition of the segment to the cycle, creating a back-and-forth pattern that enhances the schedule's complexity. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `schedule_list`: The list of scheduled items to be processed for cyclical repetition. It serves as the base sequence from which a cyclical pattern is generated, determining the overall structure and content of the output. Type should be `LIST`.
    - Outputs:
        - `schedule_list`: The resulting list after applying the cyclical pattern generation, which includes the repeated segments and, if enabled, their mirrored repetitions. Type should be `LIST`.
