- `SaltImagePasteCrop`: This node specializes in blending and sharpening operations for image processing, specifically focusing on pasting cropped images onto target images with adjustable blending and sharpening parameters. It enables the creation of composite images by seamlessly integrating cropped sections into original images, enhancing visual coherence through blending and sharpening techniques.
    - Parameters:
        - `crop_blending`: Determines the intensity of blending between the original and cropped images, affecting the smoothness of the transition. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `crop_sharpening`: Specifies the level of sharpening to be applied to the cropped images, enhancing their clarity and detail. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The original images onto which the cropped images will be pasted. They serve as the base layer for the pasting operation, allowing for the creation of composite images. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `crop_images`: The cropped images to be pasted onto the original images. These images are positioned and blended according to specified parameters, enabling the integration into the original images. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `crop_data_batch`: A batch of data specifying the location, size, and additional parameters for each crop area in the original images. This data is essential for correctly aligning and integrating the cropped images during the pasting process. Type should be `CROP_DATA_BATCH`.
    - Outputs:
        - `images`: The result of pasting the cropped images onto the original, after blending and sharpening adjustments. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `masks`: Masks indicating the areas affected by the pasting operation, useful for further image processing steps. Type should be `IMAGE`.
