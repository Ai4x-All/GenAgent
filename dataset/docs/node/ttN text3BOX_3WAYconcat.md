- `ttN text3BOX_3WAYconcat`: This node is designed to concatenate three input strings in various ways, using a specified delimiter. It enables the creation of multiple concatenated string outcomes from the provided inputs, offering flexibility in text manipulation.
    - Parameters:
        - `text1`: The first text string to be concatenated. It plays a crucial role in the concatenation process, affecting the outcome based on its content. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text2`: The second text string to be concatenated. Its inclusion allows for diverse concatenation combinations with the other input texts. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text3`: The third text string to be concatenated. It adds to the variety of possible concatenation outcomes, enriching the text manipulation capabilities. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `delimiter`: A string used to separate the texts in the concatenation process. It defines the boundary between texts, influencing the final concatenated string's format. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `text1`: The original first input text, returned unchanged. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text2`: The original second input text, returned unchanged. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text3`: The original third input text, returned unchanged. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `1 & 2`: The concatenation of the first and second input texts, separated by the specified delimiter. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `1 & 3`: The concatenation of the first and third input texts, separated by the specified delimiter. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `2 & 3`: The concatenation of the second and third input texts, separated by the specified delimiter. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `concat`: The concatenation of all three input texts, in order, separated by the specified delimiter. Type should be `STRING`.
