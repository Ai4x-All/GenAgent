- `InstructPixToPixConditioning`: This node is designed for encoding images into a conditioning format suitable for the InstructPix2Pix model, incorporating both positive and negative conditioning alongside pixel data and a variational autoencoder (VAE).
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `positive`: Positive conditioning data that influences the encoding process towards desired outcomes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Negative conditioning data that guides the encoding away from undesired outcomes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `vae`: A variational autoencoder used to encode the pixel data into a latent space representation. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `pixels`: The pixel data of the image to be encoded, serving as the base for generating latent representations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `positive`: Encoded positive conditioning data. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Encoded negative conditioning data. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent`: The latent space representation of the input image. Type should be `LATENT`.
