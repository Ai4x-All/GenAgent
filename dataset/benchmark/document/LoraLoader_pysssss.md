- `LoraLoader_pysssss`: This node specializes in loading and applying LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adjustments to models and clips, enhancing their capabilities or altering their behavior based on specified LoRA configurations. It extends the functionality of a base loader to also handle image-specific LoRA configurations, making it versatile for various multimedia applications.
    - Inputs:
        - `model` (Required): The model to which the LoRA adjustments will be applied. It's crucial for defining the base architecture that will be enhanced or modified through LoRA. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip` (Required): The CLIP model to which the LoRA adjustments will be applied, allowing for enhanced or altered multimodal understanding and representation. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `lora_name` (Required): Specifies the name of the LoRA configuration to be applied, determining the specific adjustments and enhancements to the model and clip. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `strength_model` (Required): Defines the intensity of the LoRA adjustments applied to the model, allowing for fine-tuned control over the modifications. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `strength_clip` (Required): Defines the intensity of the LoRA adjustments applied to the CLIP model, enabling precise control over the enhancements. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The model with applied LoRA adjustments, reflecting enhanced or altered capabilities. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The CLIP model with applied LoRA adjustments, showcasing enhanced or altered multimodal understanding and representation. Type should be `CLIP`.
