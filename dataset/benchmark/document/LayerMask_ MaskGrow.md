- `LayerMask_ MaskGrow`: The MaskGrow node is designed to modify image masks by inverting, growing, and blurring them to achieve a desired visual effect. This node allows for the dynamic adjustment of mask boundaries and texture, facilitating more nuanced and flexible image manipulation.
    - Inputs:
        - `mask` (Required): The 'mask' parameter represents the image mask to be processed. It is the primary input for transformations, determining the base form on which the node operates. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `invert_mask` (Required): The 'invert_mask' parameter controls whether the input mask should be inverted before processing. This inversion can be crucial for achieving specific visual effects or mask manipulations. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `grow` (Required): The 'grow' parameter specifies the amount by which the mask's boundaries should be expanded or contracted, allowing for dynamic resizing of the mask area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blur` (Required): The 'blur' parameter determines the intensity of the blur effect applied to the mask's edges, enabling the creation of softer or more pronounced boundaries. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The output 'mask' is the transformed version of the input mask, after applying the specified inversion, growth, and blur operations. Type should be `MASK`.
