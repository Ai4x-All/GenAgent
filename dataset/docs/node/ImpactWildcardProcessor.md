- `ImpactWildcardProcessor`: The ImpactWildcardProcessor node is designed to process text inputs by populating them with dynamic content based on predefined wildcards. It allows for the customization of text through the use of wildcards, enabling the generation of varied and context-specific outputs.
    - Parameters:
        - `wildcard_text`: The text containing wildcards that need to be populated. It serves as the template for generating dynamic content. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `populated_text`: The text after wildcards have been replaced with their corresponding values. It represents the final output with dynamic content populated. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `mode`: A boolean flag indicating whether the text should be populated (True) or left as is (False). This allows for flexibility in processing the text based on user preference. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `seed`: An integer used to seed the random number generator for consistent wildcard replacement. This ensures reproducibility of the output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `Select to add Wildcard`: Allows the user to select specific wildcards to add to the text, providing control over the customization of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `string`: The processed text with wildcards replaced by their corresponding values, ready for use. Type should be `STRING`.
