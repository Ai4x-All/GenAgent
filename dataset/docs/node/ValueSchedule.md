- `ValueSchedule`: The ValueSchedule node is designed to animate values over a sequence of frames based on keyframes defined in a text input. It modulates the current frame within the maximum frame range and computes interpolated values to provide dynamic, frame-specific outputs.
    - Parameters:
        - `text`: A multiline string containing keyframes for animation, serving as the blueprint for generating interpolated values across frames. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `max_frames`: The maximum number of frames for the animation, setting an upper limit for frame modulation and interpolation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `current_frame`: The current frame number, used to determine the specific value to be output based on the animation's progression. Type should be `INT`.
        - `print_output`: A boolean flag that, when true, prints the current frame and its corresponding value for debugging purposes. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `float`: The interpolated value for the current frame as a floating-point number. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `int`: The interpolated value for the current frame, cast to an integer. Type should be `INT`.
