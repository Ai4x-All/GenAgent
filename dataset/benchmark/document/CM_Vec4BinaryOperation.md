- `CM_Vec4BinaryOperation`: The node CM_Vec4BinaryOperation performs binary operations on two 4-dimensional vectors (Vec4), resulting in a new Vec4 that represents the outcome of the operation. It abstracts complex vector arithmetic into simple, high-level operations, facilitating mathematical manipulations in vector space.
    - Inputs:
        - `op` (Required): Specifies the binary operation to be performed on the vectors. It determines how the two Vec4 inputs will be combined to produce the output Vec4. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `a` (Required): The first 4-dimensional vector (Vec4) input for the binary operation. Acts as one of the operands in the vector arithmetic. Type should be `VEC4`.
        - `b` (Required): The second 4-dimensional vector (Vec4) input for the binary operation. Acts as the other operand in the vector arithmetic. Type should be `VEC4`.
    - Outputs:
        - `vec4`: The result of the binary operation on the two Vec4 inputs, returned as a new Vec4. Type should be `VEC4`.
