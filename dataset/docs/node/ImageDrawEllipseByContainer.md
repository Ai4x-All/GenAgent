- `ImageDrawEllipseByContainer`: This node is designed to draw ellipses within a specified container, leveraging parameters such as position, size, color, and anti-aliasing options to customize the appearance of the ellipse. It abstracts the complexity of drawing operations, providing a simplified interface for creating ellipses in images.
    - Parameters:
        - `start_x`: The starting x-coordinate for the ellipse, defining one axis of its bounding box. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_y`: The starting y-coordinate for the ellipse, defining one axis of its bounding box. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_x`: The ending x-coordinate for the ellipse, defining the opposite axis of its bounding box. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_y`: The ending y-coordinate for the ellipse, defining the opposite axis of its bounding box. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `outline_size`: Specifies the thickness of the ellipse's outline. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_red`: The red component of the ellipse's outline color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_green`: The green component of the ellipse's outline color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_blue`: The blue component of the ellipse's outline color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_alpha`: The alpha (transparency) component of the ellipse's outline color. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `fill_red`: The red component of the ellipse's fill color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_green`: The green component of the ellipse's fill color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_blue`: The blue component of the ellipse's fill color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_alpha`: The alpha (transparency) component of the ellipse's fill color. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `SSAA`: Super Sample Anti-Aliasing factor to improve the quality of the drawing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `method`: Specifies the drawing method or algorithm used for rendering the ellipse. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `container`: The container specifies the image or canvas area where the ellipse will be drawn. It determines the bounds and context of the drawing operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is an image with the specified ellipse drawn within the container. Type should be `IMAGE`.
