- `Cache Node`: The Cache Node is designed to manage the caching process within a workflow, specifically handling the loading and saving of various types of data such as latent representations, images, and conditioning information. It facilitates efficient data retrieval and storage, optimizing the workflow's performance by reducing redundant computations and data loading times.
    - Inputs:
        - `latent_suffix` (Required): Specifies the suffix for the latent data cache file. It is crucial for identifying and retrieving precomputed latent representations, enhancing efficiency by avoiding redundant computations. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `image_suffix` (Required): Indicates the suffix for the image data cache file. This parameter is essential for identifying and accessing pre-stored images, streamlining the workflow by eliminating the need for repeated image loading. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `conditioning_suffix` (Required): Defines the suffix for the conditioning data cache file. It plays a key role in identifying and fetching precomputed conditioning information, thereby speeding up the data preparation process for model inputs. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `output_path` (Optional): Specifies the directory path where the cache files are stored or will be stored. This parameter is essential for directing where to save or load cache files. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `latent` (Optional): The latent representation data to be cached. This parameter is optional and is used when saving data to the cache. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `image` (Optional): The image data to be cached. This parameter is optional and is used when saving data to the cache. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `conditioning` (Optional): The conditioning information to be cached. This parameter is optional and is used when saving data to the cache. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent_filename`: The filename of the latent representation data cache file. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `image_filename`: The filename of the image data cache file. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `conditioning_filename`: The filename of the conditioning data cache file. Type should be `STRING`.
