- `SamplerCustom`: The SamplerCustom node is designed to provide a customizable sampling framework within a generative model pipeline, allowing for the integration of various sampling strategies and configurations to tailor the generation process according to specific requirements or preferences.
    - Parameters:
        - `add_noise`: Determines whether noise should be added to the sampling process, affecting the texture and details of the generated output. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `noise_seed`: Sets the seed for noise generation, ensuring consistency in the noise pattern when adding noise to the sampling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Controls the conditioning factor, adjusting the influence of specified conditions on the generation outcome. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: Specifies the generative model to be used for sampling, serving as the foundation for the generation process. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `positive`: Specifies positive conditioning to guide the generation towards desired attributes or content. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Specifies negative conditioning to steer the generation away from undesired attributes or content. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `sampler`: Selects the specific sampling strategy to be employed, allowing for customization of the sampling behavior. Type should be `SAMPLER`.
        - `sigmas`: Defines the noise levels to be used at each step of the sampling process, influencing the detail and quality of the generated output. Type should be `SIGMAS`.
        - `latent_image`: Provides the initial latent image to be transformed through the sampling process, serving as the starting point for generation. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `output`: Produces a latent representation of the generated content, encapsulating the result of the sampling process. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `denoised_output`: Provides a denoised version of the generated content, offering an alternative representation with potentially clearer details. Type should be `LATENT`.
