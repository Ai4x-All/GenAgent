- `ADE_AnimateDiffSamplingSettings`: This node is designed to configure and apply advanced sampling settings for the AnimateDiff process, enabling precise control over the animation generation process through detailed sampling parameters.
    - Parameters:
        - `batch_offset`: Specifies the offset for the batch processing, allowing for sequential or staggered processing of animation frames. Type should be `INT`.
        - `noise_type`: Defines the type of noise to be applied during the sampling process, influencing the texture and details of the generated animation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed_gen`: Determines the seed generation strategy, ensuring reproducibility or variability in the animation outcomes. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed_offset`: Adjusts the seed value by a specified offset, enabling variations in the animation while maintaining a degree of control. Type should be `INT`.
        - `seed_override`: Directly overrides the seed value, offering an alternative method for controlling the animation's randomness. Type should be `INT`.
        - `adapt_denoise_steps`: Enables or disables the adaptation of denoise steps based on the animation's requirements, optimizing the generation process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `noise_layers`: Optional parameter that allows for the customization of noise layers, further refining the animation's visual characteristics. Type should be `NOISE_LAYERS`.
        - `iteration_opts`: Provides additional iteration options to fine-tune the animation process, such as step adjustments and caching strategies. Type should be `ITERATION_OPTS`.
        - `custom_cfg`: Allows for the integration of custom configuration settings, enhancing the flexibility and creativity of the animation. Type should be `CUSTOM_CFG`.
        - `sigma_schedule`: Specifies a sigma schedule to be used during sampling, affecting the diffusion process and the animation's smoothness. Type should be `SIGMA_SCHEDULE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `settings`: Returns the configured sampling settings, ready to be applied to the AnimateDiff process. Type should be `SAMPLE_SETTINGS`.
