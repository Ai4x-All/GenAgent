- `GuidedFilterAlpha`: The GuidedFilterAlpha node applies a guided filter to images using a specified alpha channel and filter parameters. This process enhances the image by smoothing while preserving edges, guided by the alpha channel to control the blending and detail levels.
    - Parameters:
        - `filter_radius`: Specifies the radius of the filter, affecting the extent of smoothing and edge preservation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `sigma`: Controls the degree of smoothing, with higher values resulting in more blur. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The input images to be filtered, where the alpha channel guides the filtering process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `alpha`: The alpha channel used to guide the filtering process, influencing how the image details are blended and preserved. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The filtered images, where the guided filter has been applied according to the alpha channel and filter parameters. Type should be `IMAGE`.
