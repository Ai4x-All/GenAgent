- `Make Image Batch`: The Make Image Batch node is designed to aggregate multiple individual images or smaller batches of images into a larger batch. This functionality is crucial for processing multiple images in parallel, enhancing efficiency in batch operations.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `image1`: The primary image to start the batch. It is a required input that serves as the base to which additional images can be appended. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image2`: An optional image that can be appended to the initial image to form a larger batch. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image3`: An optional image that can be appended to the growing batch, further increasing its size. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image4`: An optional image that can be appended to the batch, contributing to the batch's expansion. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image5`: An optional image that can be appended, further enlarging the batch size. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image6`: An optional image that can be appended, maximizing the batch's capacity. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting larger batch of images, aggregated from the individual inputs. Type should be `IMAGE`.
