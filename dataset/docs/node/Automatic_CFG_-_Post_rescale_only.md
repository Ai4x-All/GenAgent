- `Automatic CFG - Post rescale only`: This node is designed to apply a post-processing rescaling operation to the output of a generative model, specifically targeting the adjustment of the model's output based on a rescaling factor. It aims to refine the model's predictions by adjusting the scale of the output, enhancing the balance between conditioned and unconditioned components of the generation.
    - Parameters:
        - `subtract_latent_mean`: A boolean flag indicating whether the latent mean should be subtracted from the model's output, affecting the final generation's characteristics. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `subtract_latent_mean_sigma_start`: Defines the starting sigma value for subtracting the latent mean, influencing when this operation is applied during the generation process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `subtract_latent_mean_sigma_end`: Defines the ending sigma value for subtracting the latent mean, marking the end of the range within which this operation is applied. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `latent_intensity_rescale`: A boolean flag indicating whether the intensity of the latent space should be rescaled, impacting the visual quality and characteristics of the generated output. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `latent_intensity_rescale_method`: Specifies the method used for rescaling the intensity of the latent space, affecting how the rescaling operation is performed. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `latent_intensity_rescale_cfg`: The configuration value for the latent intensity rescale operation, determining the intensity of rescaling applied. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `latent_intensity_rescale_sigma_start`: Defines the starting sigma value for the latent intensity rescale operation, influencing when this adjustment is applied in the generation process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `latent_intensity_rescale_sigma_end`: Defines the ending sigma value for the latent intensity rescale operation, marking the end of the range within which this adjustment is applied. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The generative model to which the post-rescaling operation will be applied. This parameter is crucial as it determines the base model whose output will be adjusted. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The modified generative model with the post-rescaling operation applied. This output reflects the adjustments made to the model's output scaling, aimed at enhancing generation quality. Type should be `MODEL`.
