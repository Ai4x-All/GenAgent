- `BatchPromptSchedule`: The `BatchPromptSchedule` node processes user-formatted prompts to sequence and evaluate expressions within these prompts, ultimately generating a batch of conditionings based on a specified schedule. This node is designed to handle the intricacies of animation prompt scheduling, including the management of current and next prompts as well as the conditioning strength across a series of frames.
    - Parameters:
        - `text`: This input represents the user's formatted prompt, serving as the foundational content for animation sequence generation. It is crucial for defining the thematic direction and elements to be emphasized or minimized in the animation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `max_frames`: Specifies the maximum number of frames for the animation, playing a key role in defining the length and scope of the animated sequence. Type should be `INT`.
        - `print_output`: A boolean flag indicating whether to print output information for debugging or informational purposes during the animation processing. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `pre_text`: Pre-text to be added before the main prompt content, influencing the initial context or setting for the animation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `app_text`: Appended text to be added after the main prompt content, affecting the concluding context or elements in the animation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `start_frame`: The starting frame number for the animation, determining the initial point of the sequence. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_frame`: The ending frame number for the animation, determining the terminal point of the sequence. Type should be `INT`.
        - `pw_a`: A parameter weight influencing the animation's visual or thematic aspects, part of a set of weights used for fine-tuning the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_b`: Another parameter weight for adjusting the animation's characteristics, contributing to the customization of the final output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_c`: A weight parameter for further customization of the animation, allowing for specific adjustments to the visual or thematic output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_d`: The last of the parameter weights for detailed control over the animation's appearance or theme, enabling precise modifications. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip`: Refers to the clip information or settings that are essential for processing the animation. This input is critical for aligning the animation with specific visual or thematic constraints. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `POS`: This output represents the positive conditioning generated from the animation prompt, ready for further processing or utilization in the animation sequence. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `NEG`: Signifies the negative conditioning derived from the animation prompt, complementing the positive conditioning to provide a balanced and nuanced animation output. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
