- `Efficient Loader`: The Efficient Loader node is designed to streamline the process of loading and initializing models, VAEs, and other dependencies for generative tasks. It efficiently manages resources by selectively caching and reusing components, and supports customization through parameters like checkpoint names, LoRA configurations, and batch sizes. This node aims to optimize the setup phase for generative workflows, reducing overhead and facilitating quicker iterations.
