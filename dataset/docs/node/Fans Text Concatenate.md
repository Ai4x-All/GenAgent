- `Fans Text Concatenate`: This node is designed to concatenate multiple text inputs into a single string, optionally adding line breaks between each text segment. It allows for flexible text manipulation and aggregation, making it suitable for preparing text data for further processing or display.
    - Parameters:
        - `linebreak_addition`: Determines whether to add a line break between each concatenated text segment. A 'true' value inserts line breaks, while 'false' concatenates texts directly. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `prompt`: An initial piece of text to start the concatenation process. It serves as the base to which other texts are appended. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_a`: The first text to concatenate following the prompt, if provided. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_b`: The second text to concatenate following any previous texts. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_c`: The third text to concatenate, continuing the sequence of text aggregation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_d`: The fourth text in the concatenation sequence. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_e`: The fifth text to be concatenated, further extending the text string. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_f`: The sixth text to be added to the concatenated string. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_g`: The seventh text in the concatenation order. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_h`: The eighth text to be concatenated, adding more content to the string. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_i`: The ninth text in the sequence, further extending the concatenated string. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_j`: The tenth and final text to be concatenated, completing the text aggregation process. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `string`: The final concatenated text string, composed of up to ten individual text inputs and optional line breaks. Type should be `STRING`.
