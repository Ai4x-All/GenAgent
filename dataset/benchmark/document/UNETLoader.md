- `UNETLoader`: The UNETLoader node is designed for loading U-Net models by name, facilitating the use of pre-trained U-Net architectures within the system.
    - Inputs:
        - `unet_name` (Required): Specifies the name of the U-Net model to be loaded. This name is used to locate the model within a predefined directory structure, enabling the dynamic loading of different U-Net models. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: Returns the loaded U-Net model, allowing it to be utilized for further processing or inference within the system. Type should be `MODEL`.
