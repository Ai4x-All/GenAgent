- `Color (RGB)`: This node is designed for creating a color representation from individual red, green, and blue (RGB) components. It enables the specification of each color component to form a composite color, which can be used in various image processing and color manipulation tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `r`: The red component of the color, an integral value that defines the intensity of red in the final color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `g`: The green component of the color, an integral value that defines the intensity of green in the final color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `b`: The blue component of the color, an integral value that defines the intensity of blue in the final color. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `color`: The composite color formed from the specified red, green, and blue components. This output is significant for subsequent image processing or color manipulation tasks, providing a standardized color format. Type should be `COLOR`.
