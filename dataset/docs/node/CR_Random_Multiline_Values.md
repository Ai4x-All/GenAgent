- `CR Random Multiline Values`: This node generates a multiline string composed of randomly selected characters or digits based on a specified value type. It allows for the creation of diverse patterns such as binary, decimal, natural numbers, hexadecimal, alphabetic, alphanumeric, or custom-defined sequences. The randomness can be controlled with a seed value, and the node supports customization of the output through parameters like row count, string length, and optional prepended text.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: A value used to initialize the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of the random patterns generated by the node. Type should be `INT`.
        - `value_type`: Specifies the type of characters or digits to be used in generating the multiline string. It determines the character set from which random selections are made, influencing the pattern and appearance of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `rows`: Determines the number of lines in the generated multiline string. Each line is composed of randomly selected characters or digits based on the specified value type. Type should be `INT`.
        - `string_length`: Specifies the length of each line in the multiline string, controlling how many characters or digits are randomly selected and concatenated per line. Type should be `INT`.
        - `custom_values`: Allows for the specification of a custom set of characters or digits from which the random selections are made, enabling highly customized and unique patterns. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `prepend_text`: An optional text to be prepended to each line of the generated multiline string, allowing for additional customization of the output. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `multiline_text`: The generated multiline string composed of randomly selected characters or digits, arranged according to the specified parameters. Type should be `*`.
        - `show_help`: A URL providing access to further documentation and help related to the node's functionality. Type should be `STRING`.
