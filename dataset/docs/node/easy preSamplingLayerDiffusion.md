- `easy preSamplingLayerDiffusion`: This node is designed to apply a layer diffusion process to images before sampling, enhancing the generation of images by blending different layers based on specified methods. It allows for the customization of the diffusion process through various parameters, including method selection, weight adjustment, and step configuration, to achieve desired visual effects.
    - Parameters:
        - `method`: Specifies the layer diffusion method to be applied, influencing how layers are blended and the overall visual outcome. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `weight`: Determines the influence of the diffusion method on the image, allowing for fine-tuning of the blending effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `steps`: Defines the number of steps to execute in the layer diffusion process, affecting the depth of the diffusion effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Configuration setting that influences the generative model's behavior during the diffusion process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Specifies the sampling algorithm used in the generative process, affecting the quality and characteristics of the generated image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Determines the scheduling algorithm for the diffusion steps, impacting the progression and outcome of the image generation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: Adjusts the level of denoising applied during the diffusion process, influencing the clarity and detail of the generated image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `seed`: Sets the random seed for the generative process, ensuring reproducibility of the generated images. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Represents the pipeline configuration for image generation, serving as the foundation for the layer diffusion process. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `image`: Optional input image that can be used as a base or reference in the diffusion process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `blended_image`: Optional input image to be blended with the base image during the diffusion process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: Optional mask to specify areas of the image to be affected or protected during the diffusion process. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: Outputs the modified pipeline configuration after applying the layer diffusion process. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
