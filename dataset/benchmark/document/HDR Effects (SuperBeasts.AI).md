- `HDR Effects (SuperBeasts.AI)`: The HDR Effects node enhances images by applying High Dynamic Range (HDR) effects, improving the visual quality through adjustments in contrast, color saturation, and brightness. It utilizes advanced image processing techniques to simulate HDR photography, making the images appear more vivid and lifelike.
    - Inputs:
        - `image` (Required): The input image to be enhanced with HDR effects. It serves as the base for all subsequent HDR-related adjustments, including contrast, color saturation, and brightness enhancements. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `hdr_intensity` (Required): Controls the overall intensity of the HDR effect applied to the image, affecting the depth and strength of shadows, highlights, and midtones adjustments. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `shadow_intensity` (Required): Determines the intensity of shadows in the image, enhancing the depth and detail in darker areas. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `highlight_intensity` (Required): Adjusts the brightness of highlights, enhancing the detail and visibility in brighter areas of the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `gamma_intensity` (Required): Modifies the gamma levels of the image, affecting the midtone luminance and overall visual contrast. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `contrast` (Required): Adjusts the contrast level of the image, making the darks darker and the lights lighter to enhance the overall dynamic range. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `enhance_color` (Required): Increases the color saturation of the image, making the colors more vivid and enhancing the overall visual appeal. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `result_img`: The enhanced image with applied HDR effects, including improved contrast, color saturation, and brightness. Type should be `IMAGE`.
