- `ReActorRestoreFace`: The ReActorRestoreFace node is designed for restoring faces in images using specified face restoration models. It adjusts the visibility of the restored face based on a given parameter, blending it with the original face to achieve a natural restoration effect.
    - Parameters:
        - `facedetection`: The face detection model used to identify faces within the input image, crucial for targeted restoration. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `model`: Specifies the model to be used for face restoration, allowing for different restoration techniques to be applied. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `visibility`: Controls the blend level between the original and restored faces, determining the visibility of the restoration effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `codeformer_weight`: A weight parameter specific to the CodeFormer model, influencing the restoration outcome. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The image to be processed for face restoration. It serves as the base for detecting faces and applying restoration models. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The result of the face restoration process, including the restored face image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
