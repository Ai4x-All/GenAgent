- `RegionalSamplerAdvanced`: The RegionalSamplerAdvanced node is designed for advanced sampling operations within specific regions of latent images. It utilizes a base sampler and additional samplers to apply complex sampling strategies, enabling precise control over the sampling process in targeted areas.
    - Parameters:
        - `add_noise`: Determines whether noise is added to the sampling process, affecting the texture and details of the sampled output. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `noise_seed`: Sets the seed for noise generation, ensuring reproducibility of the noise patterns in the sampling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Specifies the number of steps to perform in the sampling process, influencing the depth and detail of the sampling. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_at_step`: Defines the starting step for the sampling process, allowing for partial sampling starting from a specific point. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_at_step`: Determines the ending step for the sampling process, enabling partial sampling up to a specific point. Type should be `INT`.
        - `overlap_factor`: Controls the overlap between sampled regions, affecting the blending and transition between sampled areas. Type should be `INT`.
        - `restore_latent`: Indicates whether the original latent image is restored after sampling, preserving the original content outside the sampled regions. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `return_with_leftover_noise`: Determines whether the sampled output includes leftover noise, adding an additional layer of texture to the output. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `additional_mode`: Defines the mode for additional sampling operations, allowing for customization of the sampling strategy. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `additional_sampler`: Specifies the additional sampler used for enhanced sampling operations, providing flexibility in the sampling approach. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `additional_sigma_ratio`: Sets the sigma ratio for additional sampling operations, influencing the variance and intensity of the sampling. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `latent_image`: The latent image to be sampled, serving as the base for the sampling operations. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `base_sampler`: The base sampler used for the initial sampling process, setting the foundation for further sampling operations. Type should be `KSAMPLER_ADVANCED`.
        - `regional_prompts`: Specifies the regional prompts used to guide the sampling process in specific areas, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of the sampled output. Type should be `REGIONAL_PROMPTS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The latent image after the advanced regional sampling process, reflecting the targeted modifications and enhancements. Type should be `LATENT`.
