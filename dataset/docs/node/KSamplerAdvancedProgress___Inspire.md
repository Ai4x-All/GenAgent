- `KSamplerAdvancedProgress __Inspire`: This node is designed to progressively sample images using an advanced KSampler algorithm, tailored for the Inspire pack. It iteratively refines the image generation process, allowing for detailed adjustments and enhancements at each step, based on a set of input parameters and conditions.
    - Parameters:
        - `add_noise`: Determines whether noise should be added at the start of the sampling process, affecting the initial state and potentially the diversity of the generated images. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `noise_seed`: Provides a seed for the noise generation, ensuring reproducibility and consistency in the images generated with added noise. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Specifies the number of steps to perform in the sampling process, directly influencing the refinement and detail of the generated images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Configuration settings for the sampling process, allowing for customization of the generation according to specific requirements. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Identifies the specific sampler algorithm to be used, enabling the selection of different sampling strategies within the advanced KSampler framework. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Defines the scheduling algorithm for controlling the sampling process, impacting the progression and quality of image generation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_at_step`: The step at which to begin the sampling process, allowing for starting the refinement from a specific point in the generation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_at_step`: The final step at which the sampling process concludes, defining the extent of the progressive refinement. Type should be `INT`.
        - `noise_mode`: Specifies the mode of noise application during the sampling process, affecting the texture and details of the generated images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `return_with_leftover_noise`: Indicates whether to include leftover noise in the returned samples, potentially adding to the diversity and realism of the images. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `interval`: The interval at which to capture and return intermediate samples, allowing for observation of the progression throughout the sampling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `omit_start_latent`: If set to true, the initial latent image is omitted from the results, focusing the output on the progression made during the sampling. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model parameter specifies the generative model to be used for sampling, playing a crucial role in determining the quality and style of the generated images. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `positive`: Positive prompts or conditions to guide the image generation towards desired attributes or themes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Negative prompts or conditions to steer the image generation away from certain attributes or themes, refining the output. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent_image`: The initial latent image to start the sampling from, setting the baseline for the progressive refinement process. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `prev_progress_latent_opt`: Optional previous progress latent to be concatenated with the current sampling results, enabling continuous progression across multiple sampling sessions. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The final latent image after the completion of the sampling process, representing the culmination of the progressive refinement. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `progress_latent`: A collection of latent images captured at specified intervals during the sampling process, showcasing the progression and evolution of the image generation. Type should be `LATENT`.
