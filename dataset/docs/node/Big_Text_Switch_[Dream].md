- `Big Text Switch [Dream]`: The Big Text Switch node is designed to dynamically select one of several text inputs based on a specified condition. It facilitates conditional logic within a flow, allowing for the selection of text values based on runtime criteria.
    - Parameters:
        - `select`: Specifies the index of the text input to be selected. It plays a crucial role in determining which text input is chosen based on the condition provided. Type should be `INT`.
        - `on_missing`: Defines the behavior when the selected text input does not meet the specified condition, allowing for a fallback mechanism to either the previous or next valid input. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `input_i`: Represents one of the ten text inputs available for selection, where 'i' can range from 0 to 9. Each input can be individually set to a default value, ensuring a value is always available even if not explicitly provided. The index 'i' allows for dynamic selection among multiple inputs. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `selected`: The text value selected based on the specified condition and inputs. It represents the outcome of the conditional logic applied by the node. Type should be `STRING`.
