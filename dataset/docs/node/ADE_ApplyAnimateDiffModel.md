- `ADE_ApplyAnimateDiffModel`: The ADE_ApplyAnimateDiffModel node is designed to apply advanced AnimateDiff model configurations to generate motion in images. It leverages a comprehensive set of parameters to fine-tune the animation process, accommodating a wide range of motion effects and styles.
    - Parameters:
        - `start_percent`: Defines the starting percentage of the animation effect, marking the beginning of the motion's application. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_percent`: Specifies the ending percentage of the animation effect, determining the point at which the motion ceases. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `motion_model`: Specifies the motion model to be used for animation. It is crucial for defining the animation's behavior and characteristics. Type should be `MOTION_MODEL_ADE`.
        - `motion_lora`: Optional parameter that allows for the adjustment of motion using LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques, enhancing the animation's quality. Type should be `MOTION_LORA`.
        - `scale_multival`: Optional parameter that influences the scale of the animation effect, allowing for fine-tuning of the animation's intensity. Type should be `MULTIVAL`.
        - `effect_multival`: Optional parameter that adjusts the overall effect of the animation, enabling customization of the visual outcome. Type should be `MULTIVAL`.
        - `ad_keyframes`: Optional parameter that specifies keyframes for the animation, allowing for precise control over the motion's timing and sequence. Type should be `AD_KEYFRAMES`.
        - `prev_m_models`: Optional parameter that includes previous motion models to be considered in the current animation process, allowing for cumulative effects. Type should be `M_MODELS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `m_models`: Outputs the motion models used in the animation process, encapsulating all adjustments and configurations made. Type should be `M_MODELS`.
