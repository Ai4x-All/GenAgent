- `BasicPipeToDetailerPipeSDXL`: This node is designed to transform a basic pipeline configuration into a more detailed pipeline configuration specifically tailored for the SDXL model. It enriches the basic pipeline by incorporating additional models, clips, VAEs, and conditioning parameters, along with optional elements like SAM models and segmentation detectors, to enhance the detail and precision of the output.
    - Parameters:
        - `wildcard`: A flexible string input that can be used for dynamic prompts or additional instructions not covered by other parameters. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `Select to add LoRA`: Allows the selection of LoRA layers to be added to the text, enhancing the model's ability to adapt to specific tasks or domains. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `Select to add Wildcard`: Enables the selection of predefined wildcards to be added to the text, offering more control over the generation process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `base_basic_pipe`: unknown Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
        - `refiner_basic_pipe`: unknown Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
        - `bbox_detector`: A bounding box detector model that identifies and locates objects within images, useful for targeted manipulations or enhancements. Type should be `BBOX_DETECTOR`.
        - `sam_model_opt`: An optional SAM model that can be used for sharpening and adjusting the focus of generated images, improving their clarity. Type should be `SAM_MODEL`.
        - `segm_detector_opt`: An optional segmentation detector that can be used for identifying and segmenting specific parts of images, useful for detailed manipulations. Type should be `SEGM_DETECTOR`.
        - `detailer_hook`: An optional hook that allows for custom modifications or enhancements to the detailing process, providing flexibility in the pipeline's behavior. Type should be `DETAILER_HOOK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `detailer_pipe`: The detailed pipeline configuration resulting from the transformation, tailored for the SDXL model. Type should be `DETAILER_PIPE`.
