- `ImageTransformCropRelative`: The `ImageTransformCropRelative` node provides functionality for cropping images based on relative positions. It allows for dynamic cropping by specifying start and end points as fractions of the image's dimensions, enabling flexible image manipulation without the need for absolute pixel values.
    - Parameters:
        - `start_x`: Specifies the relative starting x-coordinate for the cropping operation, as a fraction of the image's width. It determines the left boundary of the crop. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_y`: Specifies the relative starting y-coordinate for the cropping operation, as a fraction of the image's height. It determines the top boundary of the crop. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_x`: Specifies the relative ending x-coordinate for the cropping operation, as a fraction of the image's width. It determines the right boundary of the crop. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_y`: Specifies the relative ending y-coordinate for the cropping operation, as a fraction of the image's height. It determines the bottom boundary of the crop. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The `images` parameter represents the collection of images to be cropped. It is crucial for defining the input images on which the cropping operation will be performed. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is a cropped version of the input images, adjusted according to the specified relative start and end coordinates. Type should be `IMAGE`.
