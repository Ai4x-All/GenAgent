- `WeightScheduleConvert`: The `WeightScheduleConvert` node is designed to transform weight schedules, adapting them to different contexts or requirements. This node abstracts the process of converting weight schedules, focusing on the flexibility and adaptability of weight schedules across various applications.
    - Parameters:
        - `input_values`: Represents the initial values for conversion, serving as the primary input. Its role is pivotal in defining the conversion process's starting point. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `output_type`: Specifies the desired output format of the conversion, influencing the structure and format of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `invert`: A boolean flag that determines whether the input values should be inverted during the conversion process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `repeat`: Defines how many times the input values should be repeated in the output, affecting the length and composition of the result. Type should be `INT`.
        - `remap_to_frames`: Optional parameter that allows remapping the output to a specific number of frames, adjusting the conversion to fit a predetermined frame count. Type should be `INT`.
        - `interpolation_curve`: Optional parameter that specifies the curve used for interpolation during conversion, affecting the smoothness and distribution of the output values. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `float`: Outputs the converted values in the specified format, reflecting the adaptations made during the conversion process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
