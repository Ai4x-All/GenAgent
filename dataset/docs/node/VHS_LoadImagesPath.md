- `VHS_LoadImagesPath`: The VHS_LoadImagesPath node is designed for loading images from a specified directory path into a video editing or processing workflow. It supports filtering and selection options to customize the set of images loaded, facilitating efficient management and manipulation of image batches within the Video Helper Suite.
    - Parameters:
        - `directory`: Specifies the directory from which images are to be loaded. This parameter is crucial for determining the source of the images to be processed. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `image_load_cap`: Limits the number of images to be loaded from the directory, allowing for control over the batch size for processing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `skip_first_images`: Skips a specified number of images at the beginning of the directory, enabling selective loading of images based on order. Type should be `INT`.
        - `select_every_nth`: Loads every nth image from the directory, providing a method to thin out the image set for processing. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The loaded images, ready for further processing or manipulation within the workflow. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: Generated masks for the loaded images, useful for image editing tasks that require segmentation or selective editing. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `int`: The total count of images loaded, offering insight into the batch size after applying loading parameters. Type should be `INT`.
