- `CR LoRA List`: The CR LoRA List node is designed to compile and manage lists of LoRA (Layer-wise Relevance Propagation) configurations, facilitating the organization and application of multiple LoRA settings in animation projects. It supports the dynamic addition of LoRA configurations to an existing list, enabling users to efficiently manage and apply various LoRA effects based on specific animation requirements.
    - Parameters:
        - `lora_name1`: Specifies the first LoRA configuration name to be added to the list, playing a crucial role in defining the initial set of LoRA settings for the animation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `alias1`: Provides an alias for the first LoRA configuration, offering a simplified reference to this specific set of LoRA settings. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `model_strength_1`: Determines the strength of the model's influence for the first LoRA configuration, affecting the overall impact of this LoRA setting on the animation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `clip_strength_1`: Defines the clip strength for the first LoRA configuration, influencing how prominently this particular LoRA setting will affect the animation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `lora_name2`: Specifies the second LoRA configuration name to be added to the list, allowing for the expansion of LoRA settings within the animation project. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `alias2`: Provides an alias for the second LoRA configuration, facilitating easier identification and application of this set of LoRA settings. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `model_strength_2`: Determines the strength of the model's influence for the second LoRA configuration, contributing to the diversity of LoRA effects available for the animation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `clip_strength_2`: Defines the clip strength for the second LoRA configuration, adding another layer of LoRA effect to the animation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `lora_name3`: Specifies the third LoRA configuration name to be added to the list, further broadening the range of LoRA settings for the animation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `alias3`: Provides an alias for the third LoRA configuration, simplifying the management and application of a wider range of LoRA settings. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `model_strength_3`: Determines the strength of the model's influence for the third LoRA configuration, enhancing the animation with additional LoRA effects. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `clip_strength_3`: Defines the clip strength for the third LoRA configuration, contributing to the overall variety of LoRA settings in the animation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `lora_list`: An existing list of LoRA configurations to which new settings can be added, enabling the dynamic management and application of multiple LoRA effects in the animation. Type should be `lora_LIST`.
    - Outputs:
        - `LORA_LIST`: A compiled list of LoRA configurations, including any newly added settings, ready for application in animation projects. Type should be `LORA_LIST`.
        - `show_text`: A textual representation of the compiled LoRA configurations, providing an overview of the current LoRA settings for reference or documentation purposes. Type should be `STRING`.
