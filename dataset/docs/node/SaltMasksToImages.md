- `SaltMasksToImages`: This node is designed to convert a collection of mask images into a tensor representation, facilitating the transition from image processing to tensor operations for further computational tasks.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `masks`: The masks input represents a collection of mask images that are to be converted into tensor format. This conversion is crucial for enabling subsequent tensor-based operations and analyses. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `images`: The output is a tensor comprising the converted images from the input masks, ready for further processing or analysis. Type should be `IMAGE`.
