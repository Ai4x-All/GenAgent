- `SeargeVAELoader`: The SeargeVAELoader node is designed for loading pre-trained VAE models by name, facilitating the integration of these models into the processing pipeline for various tasks such as image generation or manipulation.
    - Inputs:
        - `vae_name` (Required): Specifies the name of the VAE model to be loaded, serving as a key to retrieve the corresponding pre-trained model. Type should be `VAE_NAME`.
    - Outputs:
        - `vae`: Returns the loaded VAE model, ready for use in downstream tasks such as encoding or decoding images. Type should be `VAE`.
