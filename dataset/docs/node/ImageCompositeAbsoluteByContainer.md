- `ImageCompositeAbsoluteByContainer`: This node is designed to composite two images within a specified container, adjusting their positions and sizes based on absolute coordinates. It leverages the container's dimensions to ensure the images fit perfectly, providing a flexible way to manage image layouts within predefined spatial constraints.
    - Parameters:
        - `images_a_x`: The x-coordinate for the top-left corner of the first image within the container. Type should be `INT`.
        - `images_a_y`: The y-coordinate for the top-left corner of the first image within the container. Type should be `INT`.
        - `images_b_x`: The x-coordinate for the top-left corner of the second image within the container. Type should be `INT`.
        - `images_b_y`: The y-coordinate for the top-left corner of the second image within the container. Type should be `INT`.
        - `background`: Specifies which image (if any) should be treated as the background in the composition process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `method`: The method used for compositing the images, which can affect the final appearance. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `container`: The container image within which the other images are to be composited. It defines the spatial boundaries for the composition. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `images_a`: The first image to be composited within the container. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `images_b`: The second image to be composited within the container. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The result of the compositing process, which is a single image combining the input images according to the specified parameters and method. Type should be `IMAGE`.
