- `easy controlnetLoader`: This node is designed to apply control net configurations to a given pipeline, enhancing or modifying the generation process based on the control net's parameters. It allows for dynamic adjustment of the control net's influence through various parameters, enabling fine-tuned control over the generation outcome.
    - Parameters:
        - `control_net_name`: Specifies the name of the control net to be applied. This is crucial for identifying which control net configuration to load and apply to the pipeline. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `strength`: Determines the intensity of the control net's effect on the generation process, allowing for subtle to significant modifications. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `scale_soft_weights`: Adjusts the scaling of soft weights within the control net, offering another layer of control over how the control net influences the generation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Represents the pipeline to which the control net configurations will be applied, serving as the foundation for the generation process. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `image`: The image that will be used in conjunction with the control net to influence the generation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `control_net`: An optional parameter that allows for the direct passing of a control net object, bypassing the need for loading from a name. This is useful for advanced use cases where the control net is dynamically generated or modified. Type should be `CONTROL_NET`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The modified pipeline after applying the control net, reflecting any changes or enhancements made by the control net's parameters. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `positive`: The positive conditioning component of the pipeline, potentially altered by the control net's application. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: The negative conditioning component of the pipeline, potentially altered by the control net's application. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
