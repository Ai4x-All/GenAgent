- `WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor`: The WildcardAndLoraSyntaxProcessor node is designed to process text inputs by identifying and handling both wildcard and Lora syntax patterns. This dual functionality allows for the dynamic modification of text based on predefined patterns and the integration of Lora model adjustments directly within text inputs, facilitating a more flexible and powerful text manipulation and model interaction capability.
    - Parameters:
        - `text`: The 'text' parameter is the primary input text that the node processes. It is crucial for the operation as it contains the wildcard and Lora syntax patterns that need to be identified and handled. The processing of this text enables the dynamic modification and model interaction based on the specified patterns. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `seed`: The 'seed' parameter is used to introduce a deterministic element in the processing of wildcard patterns, ensuring reproducibility of results across different runs with the same input. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The 'model' parameter represents the model that may be adjusted based on Lora syntax within the input text, allowing for dynamic model manipulation. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The 'clip' parameter represents the clip model that may be adjusted alongside the main model in response to Lora syntax within the input text, facilitating coordinated model adjustments. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The 'model' output is the potentially modified model after processing Lora syntax adjustments specified in the input text. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The 'clip' output is the potentially modified clip model after processing Lora syntax adjustments specified in the input text. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `text`: The output 'text' is the modified version of the input text after the wildcard and Lora syntax patterns have been processed. This includes the application of dynamic modifications and model adjustments specified within the input text. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `unprocessed_text`: The 'unprocessed_text' output provides the original input text before any processing of wildcard or Lora syntax patterns, preserving the initial state for reference or further use. Type should be `STRING`.
