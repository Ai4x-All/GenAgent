- `SRStringPromptInput`: The SRStringPromptInput node is designed to integrate string inputs into a prompt's structure, specifically targeting the enhancement of semantic resolution within the prompt. It focuses on accepting a string input and embedding it into a given prompt's context, thereby enriching the prompt's descriptive capacity and specificity.
    - Inputs:
        - `input_str` (Required): The primary string input that is to be integrated into the prompt. This input is crucial for tailoring the prompt's content to specific requirements or contexts, thereby enhancing its relevance and effectiveness. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `string`: The modified prompt structure, now containing the integrated string input. This output reflects the enhanced descriptive capacity of the prompt, achieved through the incorporation of the specified string. Type should be `STRING`.
