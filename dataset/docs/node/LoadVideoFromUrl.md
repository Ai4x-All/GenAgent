- `LoadVideoFromUrl`: The LoadVideoFromUrl node is designed to facilitate the loading of video content from URLs into a format suitable for further processing or analysis. It supports handling various URL formats, including direct links to video files, and converting them into a standardized video format for use within the system.
    - Parameters:
        - `video`: The 'video' parameter is a string representing the URL of the video to be loaded. It plays a crucial role in determining the source from which the video will be fetched and processed. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `force_rate`: Specifies the desired frame rate for the loaded video, allowing control over the playback speed or frame rate normalization. Type should be `INT`.
        - `force_size`: Defines the target resolution for the loaded video, enabling resizing or aspect ratio adjustments. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `custom_width`: Sets a custom width for the loaded video, overriding the default or specified 'force_size' width. Type should be `INT`.
        - `custom_height`: Sets a custom height for the loaded video, overriding the default or specified 'force_size' height. Type should be `INT`.
        - `frame_load_cap`: Limits the number of frames to be loaded from the video, useful for processing long videos or sampling. Type should be `INT`.
        - `skip_first_frames`: Skips a specified number of frames at the beginning of the video, useful for bypassing unneeded content or intros. Type should be `INT`.
        - `select_every_nth`: Loads every nth frame from the video, allowing for frame rate reduction or selective frame analysis. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `meta_batch`: Enables batch processing of metadata for the loaded videos, optimizing for scenarios where video metadata is crucial. Type should be `VHS_BatchManager`.
    - Outputs:
        - `frames`: A list of tensors representing the loaded videos. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `frame_count`: A list containing the number of frames for each video loaded. Type should be `INT`.
        - `has_video`: A boolean indicating whether any video was successfully loaded. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
