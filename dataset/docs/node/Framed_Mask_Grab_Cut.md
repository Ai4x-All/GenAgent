- `Framed Mask Grab Cut`: This node applies the GrabCut algorithm to segment the foreground from the background in an image, utilizing a frame-based approach to enhance the segmentation accuracy. It allows for the specification of certain areas as foreground or background, improving the precision of the mask generated.
    - Parameters:
        - `iterations`: The number of iterations the GrabCut algorithm will run, affecting the refinement of the segmentation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `margin`: Specifies the margin size around the frame which is considered as definite background, aiding in more accurate segmentation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `frame_option`: Options to include or exclude certain frame areas from being considered as background, allowing for more control over the segmentation process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `threshold_FGD`: The threshold for classifying pixels as definite foreground, contributing to the initial mask creation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `threshold_PR_FGD`: The threshold for classifying pixels as probable foreground, used in refining the segmentation mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `output_format`: The format of the output, which can be either the segmented mask or the image with the background removed. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image on which the GrabCut algorithm will be applied, processed to segment the foreground from the background. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `thresh`: Threshold values used to determine the initial segmentation of the foreground and background. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output of the node, which is the segmented mask of the foreground, obtained after applying the GrabCut algorithm. Type should be `IMAGE`.
