- `TimeofdayStyler`: The TimeofdayStyler node dynamically customizes text prompts based on time-of-day styling preferences, leveraging a collection of predefined templates to enhance or modify the descriptive elements of the prompts. This node aims to provide a nuanced and contextually relevant adjustment to text generation tasks, focusing on the atmospheric and lighting conditions associated with different times of the day.
    - Inputs:
        - `text_positive` (Required): The positive text prompt to be styled, serving as the base content for time-of-day specific enhancements. This input is crucial for tailoring the output to reflect desired atmospheric conditions. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_negative` (Required): The negative text prompt to be styled, used to negate or counterbalance specific elements in the generation process. This input helps refine the output by excluding undesired time-of-day characteristics. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `timeofday` (Required): unknown Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `log_prompt` (Required): unknown Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Outputs:
        - `text_positive`: The enhanced positive text prompt, styled with time-of-day specific characteristics to better reflect desired atmospheric and lighting conditions. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_negative`: The refined negative text prompt, styled to exclude or negate undesired time-of-day elements, ensuring a more focused and relevant text generation output. Type should be `STRING`.
