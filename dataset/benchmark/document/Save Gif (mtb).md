- `Save Gif (mtb)`: This node is designed to save a sequence of images as a GIF file, offering customization options such as frame rate, size adjustment, optimization, and the choice between a standard saving method or using FFmpeg for potentially enhanced performance.
    - Inputs:
        - `image` (Required): The sequence of images to be saved as a GIF. This is the primary input that dictates the content of the resulting GIF file. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `fps` (Required): Specifies the frames per second for the GIF, controlling how fast the images in the sequence are played back. Type should be `INT`.
        - `resize_by` (Required): A scaling factor to adjust the size of the images in the GIF, with 1.0 meaning no scaling. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `optimize` (Required): A boolean indicating whether to apply optimization to the GIF, which can reduce file size at the cost of potentially longer processing times. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `pingpong` (Required): When enabled, the GIF animation will play forwards and then backwards, creating a seamless loop effect. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `resample_filter` (Required): The resampling filter to use when resizing images, affecting the quality of the resized images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `use_ffmpeg` (Required): A boolean indicating whether to use FFmpeg for GIF creation, which can offer more efficient processing for certain types of content. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
