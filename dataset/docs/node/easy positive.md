- `easy positive`: The 'easy positive' node is designed to process and enhance positive textual inputs for generative tasks, utilizing advanced techniques such as token normalization and weight interpretation to optimize the input's effectiveness. It integrates with language models and image processing tools to conditionally generate or modify content based on the positive input, aiming to achieve a desired outcome or effect.
    - Parameters:
        - `positive`: Represents the positive textual input that the node processes. This input is crucial for guiding the generative process towards generating or modifying content in a positive manner. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `positive`: The generated or enhanced positive prompt text, ready for further processing or direct use in generative tasks. This output reflects the node's processing and optimization of the positive input. Type should be `STRING`.
