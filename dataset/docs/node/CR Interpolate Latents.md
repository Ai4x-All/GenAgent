- `CR Interpolate Latents`: This node specializes in blending two latent representations based on a specified interpolation method, such as linear or spherical linear interpolation. It's designed to facilitate the creation of smooth transitions or animations between different states or frames within a generative model's latent space.
    - Parameters:
        - `weight`: A scalar value that determines the interpolation ratio between the two latent representations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `method`: Specifies the interpolation method to be used, such as 'lerp' for linear interpolation or 'slerp' for spherical linear interpolation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `latent1`: The first latent representation to be interpolated. It serves as the starting point for the interpolation process. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `latent2`: The second latent representation to be interpolated. It acts as the endpoint for the interpolation process. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `LATENT`: The resulting latent representation after applying the specified interpolation method. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `show_help`: A URL providing additional information and guidance on the interpolation methods available and their usage. Type should be `STRING`.
