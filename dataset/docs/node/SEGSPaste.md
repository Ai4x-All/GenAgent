- `SEGSPaste`: The SEGSPaste node is designed for combining multiple segmented images or elements into a single composite image. It focuses on pasting segmented elements onto a base image, allowing for the creation of complex scenes or compositions from simpler segmented parts.
    - Parameters:
        - `feather`: Determines the blending edge softness between the pasted segments and the base image, affecting the smoothness of the transitions and integration of elements. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha`: Specifies the opacity level of the pasted segments, allowing for adjustable transparency and layering effects in the composition. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The base image onto which the segmented elements will be pasted. It serves as the backdrop for the composition, influencing the final appearance of the combined image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `segs`: The segmented elements or images to be pasted onto the base image. These segments define the additional components of the scene, contributing to the complexity and detail of the final composition. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `ref_image_opt`: An optional reference image that can be used for additional context or guidance in the pasting process, enhancing the accuracy or aesthetic of the final image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: Outputs the composite image as a combination of the input base image and pasted segmented elements, effectively merging them into a single cohesive visual entity. Type should be `IMAGE`.
