- `GLIGENTextBoxApplyBatchCoords`: This node is designed to apply text box transformations to a batch of coordinates, integrating text-based conditioning and geometric transformations. It leverages CLIP models for text encoding and supports different interpolation methods for coordinate transformation, aiming to enhance image generation processes with text-driven spatial adjustments.
    - Parameters:
        - `coordinates`: Specifies the target coordinates for transformation, dictating the spatial adjustments to be applied across the batch. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text`: The text input used for conditioning, driving the spatial transformations in accordance with textual descriptions. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `width`: The width parameter for the output image, influencing the scale of applied transformations. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The height parameter for the output image, determining the vertical scale of the transformations. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `conditioning_to`: Indicates the target condition or context for the text encoding, guiding the transformation process in alignment with textual descriptions. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latents`: Represents the latent space vectors to which the transformations are applied, serving as the foundation for the subsequent image generation process. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `clip`: The CLIP model used for encoding text, facilitating the integration of text-based conditioning into the transformation process. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `gligen_textbox_model`: The specific model responsible for applying the text box transformations, central to executing the spatial adjustments. Type should be `GLIGEN`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: The modified conditioning data, enriched with text-driven spatial adjustments. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `image`: The generated image after applying the text box transformations and conditioning, showcasing the spatial adjustments. Type should be `IMAGE`.
