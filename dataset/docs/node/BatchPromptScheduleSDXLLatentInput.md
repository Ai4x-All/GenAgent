- `BatchPromptScheduleSDXLLatentInput`: This node processes animation prompts for both G and L types, applies pre and post text modifications, and then generates positive and negative prompt conditionings for each. It utilizes a batch processing approach to handle multiple prompts simultaneously, incorporating latent inputs to tailor the output conditionings. The node is designed to work with SDXL scheduling, optimizing the animation prompt processing for scenarios involving complex scheduling and interpolation requirements.
