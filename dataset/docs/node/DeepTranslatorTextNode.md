- `DeepTranslatorTextNode`: The DeepTranslatorTextNode is designed to facilitate text translation across various languages, leveraging different translation services. It abstracts the complexity of selecting and interacting with translation APIs, providing a streamlined interface for translating text with optional proxy support.
    - Parameters:
        - `from_translate`: Specifies the source language for translation, or 'auto' to enable automatic language detection based on the text content. It plays a crucial role in guiding the translation process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `to_translate`: Defines the target language for the translation, determining the language into which the text will be translated. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `add_proxies`: A flag indicating whether proxy settings should be applied to the translation request, enabling translations in environments with restricted internet access. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `proxies`: Provides the proxy configuration details if 'add_proxies' is set to True, facilitating translation requests through specified proxy servers. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `auth_data`: Contains authentication data required by certain translation services, ensuring authorized access to their APIs. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `service`: Selects the translation service to be used, such as 'GoogleTranslator', 'MyMemoryTranslator', etc., allowing for flexibility in choosing the translation provider. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `text`: The text to be translated, serving as the input for the translation process. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `text`: The translated text, providing the outcome of the translation process. Type should be `STRING`.
