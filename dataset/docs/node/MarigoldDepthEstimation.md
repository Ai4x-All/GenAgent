- `MarigoldDepthEstimation`: The MarigoldDepthEstimation node is designed for generating depth maps from single images using a diffusion-based monocular depth estimation technique. It leverages the Marigold model to produce depth maps that can be further processed or visualized. This node is capable of handling both individual images and sequences for video applications, incorporating advanced features like ensembling for improved depth map accuracy and optical flow for video frame consistency.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: Sets the random seed for depth map generation, ensuring reproducibility of results. This parameter allows for consistent outputs across multiple runs, facilitating comparisons and evaluations. Type should be `INT`.
        - `denoise_steps`: Specifies the number of steps per depth map to increase accuracy at the cost of processing time. This parameter directly influences the trade-off between the depth map's detail and the computational time required, impacting the overall execution time and the quality of the output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `n_repeat`: Determines the amount of iterations to be ensembled into a single depth map, affecting the final depth map's accuracy and detail. The higher the number, the more refined the depth map, at the expense of increased processing time. Type should be `INT`.
        - `regularizer_strength`: Adjusts the strength of the regularization during the ensembling process, typically left at default settings. While generally not modified, it can be adjusted to fine-tune the depth map's clarity and detail. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `reduction_method`: Specifies the method used for reducing the ensemble of depth maps into a single map. This choice impacts how the individual depth maps are combined, affecting the final image's quality and detail. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `max_iter`: Sets the maximum number of iterations for the ensembling process. This parameter controls how long the ensembling process can run, impacting the depth map's refinement level. Type should be `INT`.
        - `tol`: The tolerance level for the ensembling process, affecting when the process is considered complete. A lower tolerance can lead to a more detailed depth map but may increase processing time. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `invert`: Inverts the default depth map colors for compatibility with certain applications. This parameter is essential for ensuring the depth map's visual representation matches the expected format for further processing. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `keep_model_loaded`: Determines whether the depth estimation model remains loaded between invocations. Keeping the model loaded can significantly reduce processing time for subsequent images at the expense of increased memory usage. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `n_repeat_batch_size`: Controls how many of the n_repeats are processed as a batch, optimizing VRAM usage and processing speed. This parameter is crucial for managing resource utilization effectively, especially on systems with limited VRAM. Type should be `INT`.
        - `use_fp16`: Determines whether to use fp16 precision for reduced VRAM usage, with a potential impact on quality. This parameter is crucial for balancing between resource efficiency and the depth map's fidelity. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `scheduler`: Chooses the scheduler for the depth estimation process, affecting the outcome's nuances. Different schedulers can lead to variations in the depth map's appearance and accuracy, providing flexibility in the results. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `normalize`: Controls whether the output depth map is normalized. Normalization can affect the depth map's visual representation, making it more suitable for certain types of post-processing or visualization. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `model`: Selects between the Marigold model and its LCM version for depth estimation, influencing the depth map's characteristics. The choice of model affects the depth map's accuracy and the visual quality of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image for which the depth map is to be generated. This is the primary input that drives the depth estimation process, directly influencing the output's appearance and quality. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `ensembled_image`: The final ensembled depth map image, ready for further processing or visualization. This output represents the culmination of the depth estimation process, incorporating all adjustments and refinements specified through the input parameters. Type should be `IMAGE`.
