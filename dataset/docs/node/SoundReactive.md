- `SoundReactive`: The SoundReactive node is designed to process audio input, adjusting its behavior based on the sound level. It dynamically reacts to variations in sound intensity within a specified frequency range, offering customization through parameters like sound level, frequency range, and normalization. This node is particularly useful for creating audio-reactive visualizations or effects in real-time applications.
    - Parameters:
        - `sound_level`: Specifies the current sound level to be processed. It influences the node's output by scaling according to the multiplier and normalization settings, directly affecting the dynamic response to audio input. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_range_hz`: Defines the lower bound of the frequency range of interest. This parameter helps in focusing the node's sensitivity to a specific part of the audio spectrum. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_range_hz`: Sets the upper limit of the frequency range to be considered. It complements the start_range_hz to fine-tune the node's reactivity to the desired frequency band. Type should be `INT`.
        - `multiplier`: Applies a scaling factor to the sound level, allowing for enhanced control over the node's responsiveness to audio input. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `smoothing_factor`: Determines the degree of smoothing applied to the sound level, aiding in the creation of smoother transitions and effects. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `normalize`: Enables or disables normalization of the sound level, which can standardize the input range for consistent processing across different audio sources. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `sound_level`: The processed sound level, adjusted according to the node's parameters. It reflects the dynamic changes in audio intensity after scaling and optional normalization. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sound_level_int`: An integer representation of the processed sound level, providing a simplified or quantized output for scenarios where discrete levels are preferred. Type should be `INT`.
