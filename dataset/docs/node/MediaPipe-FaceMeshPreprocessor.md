- `MediaPipe-FaceMeshPreprocessor`: The MediaPipe Face Mesh Preprocessor node is designed for detecting and processing facial features in images using the MediaPipe library. It focuses on identifying faces and their key landmarks with configurable accuracy and performance settings, making it suitable for applications requiring facial analysis.
    - Parameters:
        - `max_faces`: Specifies the maximum number of faces to detect in an image. This parameter allows for control over the detection process, ensuring that the algorithm focuses on a manageable number of faces for further processing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `min_confidence`: Determines the minimum confidence level for a face to be considered detected. This threshold helps in filtering out detections that are less likely to be accurate, ensuring that only faces with a high probability of being correctly identified are processed. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `resolution`: The resolution at which the input image is processed. This parameter can affect the detection accuracy and performance of the face mesh preprocessor. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be processed for face detection and landmark annotation. This parameter is essential for the node to perform its facial analysis tasks. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is an image annotated with detected facial landmarks. This includes key points and contours for facial features such as eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth, enabling detailed facial analysis. Type should be `IMAGE`.
