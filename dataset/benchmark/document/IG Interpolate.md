- `IG Interpolate`: The IG Interpolate node is designed to facilitate the exploration of latent space by interpolating between embeddings of input images. It generates a sequence of in-between embeddings that smoothly transition from one image to the next, allowing for the creation of intermediate images that blend the features of the input images. This node is particularly useful for visualizing the path between points in latent space and understanding the underlying structure of the space.
    - Inputs:
        - `ipadapter` (Required): The ipadapter parameter is an interface for integrating with external image processing adapters, essential for configuring the node's interaction with different image processing models. Type should be `IPADAPTER`.
        - `clip_vision` (Required): The clip_vision parameter specifies the CLIP vision model to be used for encoding the input images into embeddings. This model plays a critical role in the interpolation process by providing the necessary embeddings for the input images. Type should be `CLIP_VISION`.
        - `transitioning_frames` (Required): The transitioning_frames parameter determines the number of frames to be generated between each pair of input images, directly affecting the smoothness and length of the interpolation sequence. Type should be `INT`.
        - `repeat_count` (Required): The repeat_count parameter controls the number of times each interpolated embedding is repeated in the output sequence, allowing for the adjustment of the pacing and duration of the visual transition between images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `interpolation` (Required): The interpolation parameter selects the method of interpolation (e.g., linear, ease_in, etc.) to be used for transitioning between embeddings, influencing the dynamics of the transition. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `buffer` (Required): The buffer parameter specifies the number of repetitions for the first and last embeddings in the sequence, creating a 'buffer' period at the start and end of the interpolation. This helps in creating smoother transitions and more coherent visualizations of the interpolation path. Type should be `INT`.
        - `input_images1` (Optional): The input_images1 parameter is the first set of images for which embeddings are to be interpolated, serving as one of the starting points for the interpolation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `input_images2` (Optional): The input_images2 parameter is the second set of images for which embeddings are to be interpolated, serving as another starting point for the interpolation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `input_images3` (Optional): The input_images3 parameter is the third set of images for which embeddings are to be interpolated, providing additional starting points for the interpolation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `positive_prompts` (Optional): The positive_prompts parameter is a collection of text prompts that describe desired attributes or features to be emphasized in the interpolated images. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `negative_prompts` (Optional): The negative_prompts parameter is a collection of text prompts that describe undesired attributes or features to be minimized in the interpolated images. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pos_embeds1`: The pos_embeds1 output represents the interpolated embeddings corresponding to the first set of input images. Type should be `EMBEDS`.
        - `pos_embeds2`: The pos_embeds2 output represents the interpolated embeddings corresponding to the second set of input images. Type should be `EMBEDS`.
        - `pos_embeds3`: The pos_embeds3 output represents the interpolated embeddings corresponding to the third set of input images. Type should be `EMBEDS`.
        - `neg_embeds`: The neg_embeds output represents the embeddings generated without conditioning on the input images, used for comparison or as a baseline in the interpolation process. Type should be `EMBEDS`.
        - `positive_string`: The positive_string output is a formatted string of positive prompts, structured to facilitate their integration into the interpolation process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `negative_string`: The negative_string output is a formatted string of negative prompts, structured to facilitate their integration into the interpolation process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `ipadapter`: The ipadapter output returns the configured image processing adapter used in the node, providing context for the interpolation process. Type should be `IPADAPTER`.
        - `BATCH_SIZE`: The BATCH_SIZE output indicates the total number of embeddings generated during the interpolation process, reflecting the scale of the operation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `FRAMES_TO_DROP`: The FRAMES_TO_DROP output lists specific frames that should be omitted from the final interpolated sequence to optimize the visual transition. Type should be `STRING`.
