- `ImpactLogicalOperators`: This node performs logical operations (AND, OR, XOR) on two boolean inputs, returning the result of the operation as a boolean value. It abstracts the complexity of logical decision-making processes into a simple interface, enabling conditional logic flows within a system.
    - Inputs:
        - `operator` (Required): Specifies the logical operation to be performed: AND, OR, XOR. This determines how the two boolean inputs will be combined to produce the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `bool_a` (Required): The first boolean input for the logical operation. Acts as one of the operands in the logical expression. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `bool_b` (Required): The second boolean input for the logical operation. Acts as the other operand in the logical expression. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Outputs:
        - `boolean`: The result of the logical operation performed on the two input booleans. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
