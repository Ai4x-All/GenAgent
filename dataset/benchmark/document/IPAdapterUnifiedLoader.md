- `IPAdapterUnifiedLoader`: The IPAdapterUnifiedLoader node serves as a foundational component for loading various IPAdapter configurations, facilitating the dynamic integration of different model presets and computational backends. It abstracts the complexity of handling diverse input parameters, offering a streamlined approach to adapt image processing algorithms to specific needs.
    - Inputs:
        - `model` (Required): Specifies the model to be used, serving as a key parameter in determining the processing capabilities and the output quality of the node. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `preset` (Required): Defines the preset configuration to apply, allowing for customization of the processing based on predefined settings. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `ipadapter` (Optional): Optional parameter for specifying an IPAdapter instance, enabling further customization and flexibility in processing. Type should be `IPADAPTER`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The configured model ready for use, encapsulating the selected presets and adjustments. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `ipadapter`: An optional IPAdapter instance that can be used for additional processing or customization. Type should be `IPADAPTER`.
