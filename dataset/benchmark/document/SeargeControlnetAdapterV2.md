- `SeargeControlnetAdapterV2`: The SeargeControlnetAdapterV2 node serves as an interface for adapting and applying control network configurations and annotations to input data, facilitating the enhancement or modification of images through various controlnet modes and preprocessing options. It abstracts the complexity of controlnet operations, offering customizable parameters to fine-tune the application of these networks on the input data.
    - Inputs:
        - `controlnet_mode` (Required): Specifies the mode of operation for the control network, allowing users to select different controlnet configurations for processing the input data. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `controlnet_preprocessor` (Required): A boolean flag indicating whether preprocessing should be applied before the controlnet operation, affecting the input data's preparation. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `strength` (Required): Determines the intensity of the controlnet effect, allowing for fine-tuning of the applied enhancements or modifications. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `low_threshold` (Required): Sets the lower threshold for controlnet processing, influencing the sensitivity of the operation to input data features. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `high_threshold` (Required): Defines the upper threshold for controlnet processing, adjusting the operation's responsiveness to prominent features in the input data. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_percent` (Required): Specifies the starting percentage of the input data to be processed, enabling selective application of the controlnet operation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_percent` (Required): Indicates the ending percentage of the input data that will undergo controlnet processing, allowing for targeted modifications. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `noise_augmentation` (Required): Controls the level of noise augmentation applied to the input data, enhancing the robustness of the controlnet operation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `revision_enhancer` (Required): A boolean parameter that activates an additional enhancement layer post-controlnet processing, refining the output quality. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `data` (Optional): An optional data stream input that can be processed alongside image inputs for integrated controlnet operations. Type should be `SRG_DATA_STREAM`.
        - `source_image` (Optional): An optional image input that the controlnet operation can directly modify or enhance. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `data`: Outputs the processed data stream, incorporating the applied controlnet modifications. Type should be `SRG_DATA_STREAM`.
        - `preview`: Provides a preview image showcasing the effects of the controlnet operation on the input data. Type should be `IMAGE`.
