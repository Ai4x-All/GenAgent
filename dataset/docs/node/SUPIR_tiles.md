- `SUPIR_tiles`: The SUPIR_tiles node is designed for tiling images, a process that divides a large image into smaller, manageable pieces or tiles. This functionality is essential for handling large images efficiently within the SUPIR framework, enabling detailed processing and analysis of each tile separately before reassembling them into the original image format. It supports operations such as previewing the tiling effect and potentially generating captions for each tile, facilitating a more granular approach to image analysis and manipulation.
    - Parameters:
        - `tile_size`: Defines the size of each tile. The tile size is a key factor in determining how the image is segmented into tiles, affecting both the number of tiles generated and the resolution of each tile, thereby influencing the granularity of processing and analysis. Type should be `INT`.
        - `tile_stride`: Specifies the stride for tiling. The tile stride affects how tiles are overlapped or spaced apart, playing a significant role in the coverage and redundancy of the tiling process, which can impact the comprehensiveness of the image analysis. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be tiled. This parameter is crucial as it determines the source image that will be divided into smaller tiles for processing, directly impacting the tiling operation's outcome. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image_tiles`: The resulting set of image tiles. This output is a collection of smaller, segmented pieces of the original image, each processed individually. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `tile_size`: The size of the tiles used in the tiling process. This output confirms the dimensions that were applied to segment the image into tiles, providing insight into the granularity of the analysis. Type should be `INT`.
        - `tile_stride`: The stride used for the tiling process. This output indicates the spacing or overlap between tiles, offering details on the tiling pattern and coverage. Type should be `INT`.
