- `FromListGet1Latent`: This node is designed to extract a single latent representation from a list of latents. It simplifies the process of selecting a specific latent item for further operations or analysis, making it easier to work with collections of latent representations.
    - Parameters:
        - `index`: The index of the latent representation to be extracted from the list. This parameter determines which item in the list is selected. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `list`: The list of latent representations from which a single latent is to be extracted. This parameter is crucial for specifying the source of the latent to be selected. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The single latent representation extracted from the provided list. This output is essential for downstream tasks that require a specific latent item. Type should be `LATENT`.
