- `CR Cycle LoRAs`: This node is designed to cycle through a predefined list of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) parameters sequentially or based on a schedule, applying them to a model and clip at specified intervals. It enables dynamic modification of model behaviors over time or frames, enhancing the versatility and customization of generative processes.
    - Parameters:
        - `mode`: The 'mode' input determines the cycling strategy for applying LoRA parameters, either sequentially or based on a specific schedule, influencing the dynamic adaptation process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `frame_interval`: The 'frame_interval' input specifies the interval between each LoRA parameter application, controlling the pace of modifications. Type should be `INT`.
        - `loops`: The 'loops' input indicates the number of times the cycling process should repeat, affecting the overall duration of the adaptation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `current_frame`: The 'current_frame' input is used to determine the current position in the cycling schedule, guiding the selection of LoRA parameters. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The 'model' input represents the generative model to which the LoRA parameters will be applied, serving as a base for modifications. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The 'clip' input signifies the CLIP model that will be modified alongside the generative model, using the specified LoRA parameters. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `lora_list`: The 'lora_list' input contains the predefined list of LoRA parameters to cycle through, dictating the specific adaptations to apply. Type should be `LORA_LIST`.
    - Outputs:
        - `MODEL`: The 'MODEL' output refers to the modified generative model after the application of the current LoRA parameters. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `CLIP`: The 'CLIP' output signifies the modified CLIP model after the application of the current LoRA parameters. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `show_help`: The 'show_help' output provides a URL to documentation or further information regarding the applied LoRA parameters. Type should be `STRING`.
