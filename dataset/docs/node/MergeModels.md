- `MergeModels`: The MergeModels node is designed to blend two models together based on a specified ratio, effectively merging their characteristics and features. This process allows for the creation of hybrid models that combine the strengths or attributes of both input models.
    - Parameters:
        - `ratio`: A floating-point value that determines the balance between the two models in the merging process. A ratio closer to 1.0 gives more weight to the second model's characteristics. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model1`: The first model to be merged. It serves as the base model onto which patches from the second model are applied, influenced by the specified ratio. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `model2`: The second model to be merged. Key patches from this model are applied to the first model, with the extent of their influence determined by the ratio. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The resulting model after merging the two input models according to the specified ratio. Type should be `MODEL`.
