- `ADE_CameraPoseCombo`: The ADE_CameraPoseCombo node is designed to create complex camera control poses by combining multiple motion types and their respective strengths. It allows for the customization of camera movements in animation sequences, enabling the generation of dynamic and nuanced camera behaviors.
    - Parameters:
        - `motion_type1`: Specifies the first type of camera motion to be included in the combination. Each motion type contributes to the overall camera movement pattern. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `motion_type2`: Specifies the second type of camera motion to be included in the combination, adding to the complexity of the camera movement. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `motion_type3`: Specifies the third type of camera motion, further enriching the camera movement pattern. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `motion_type4`: Specifies the fourth type of camera motion, contributing to the diversity of the camera movement. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `motion_type5`: Specifies the fifth type of camera motion, adding another layer to the camera movement complexity. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `motion_type6`: Specifies the sixth type of camera motion, completing the set of movements for a comprehensive camera control. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `speed`: Controls the speed of the camera movement, affecting how quickly or slowly the camera transitions between poses. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `frame_length`: Determines the number of frames over which the camera movement occurs, defining the duration of the animation. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `prev_poses`: Optional. Previous camera poses that can be combined with the new motion for seamless transitions in animations. This input is crucial for creating fluid and continuous camera movements, especially in scenarios where maintaining a narrative or visual continuity is essential. Type should be `CAMERACTRL_POSES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `cameractrl_poses`: The resulting camera control poses after combining the specified motions and strengths, ready for use in animations. Type should be `CAMERACTRL_POSES`.
