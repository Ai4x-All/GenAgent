- `PixelTiledKSampleUpscalerProviderPipe`: This node provides a pipeline for upscaling images using a tiled K-sample upscaling method. It integrates various components such as model selection, VAE, seed, steps, configuration, sampler name, scheduler, denoising, and tiling strategy to perform image upscaling. The node is designed to work with specific upscale models and supports customization through options like upscale model optimization, post-kernel hooks, and tile convolution network options.
