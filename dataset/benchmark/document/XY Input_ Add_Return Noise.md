- `XY Input_ Add_Return Noise`: The node TSC_XYplot_AddReturnNoise is designed to handle XY input types specifically for adding or returning noise within a given process. It maps input types to their corresponding noise actions, enabling or disabling noise based on the specified type.
    - Inputs:
        - `XY_type` (Required): Specifies the type of noise action to be performed, either adding noise or returning with leftover noise, which determines how the node processes the input. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Outputs:
        - `X or Y`: unknown Type should be `XY`.
