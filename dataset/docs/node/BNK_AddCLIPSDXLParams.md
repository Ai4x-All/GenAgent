- `BNK_AddCLIPSDXLParams`: This node is designed to augment the conditioning data with additional parameters related to image dimensions and cropping. It enriches the conditioning context by specifying width, height, crop width, crop height, target width, and target height, facilitating more precise control over the image generation process.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: Specifies the width of the image. It affects the conditioning by setting a specific dimension for image generation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Specifies the height of the image, contributing to the conditioning by defining a specific dimension for image generation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_w`: Determines the width of the crop area, allowing for more focused image generation based on the specified region. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_h`: Determines the height of the crop area, enabling more targeted image generation based on the specified region. Type should be `INT`.
        - `target_width`: Sets the target width for the image generation, influencing the final dimensions of the generated image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `target_height`: Sets the target height for the image generation, impacting the final dimensions of the generated image. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `conditioning`: The conditioning data to be augmented with image dimension and cropping parameters. It plays a crucial role in defining the context for image generation. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: The augmented conditioning data, now including specific image dimensions and cropping parameters, ready for use in further processing. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
