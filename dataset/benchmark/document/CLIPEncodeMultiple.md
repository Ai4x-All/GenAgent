- `CLIPEncodeMultiple`: The CLIPEncodeMultiple node is designed to encode multiple text inputs into a conditioning format using a CLIP model. It iterates over a specified number of inputs, encoding each one separately and aggregating the results into a list of conditionings. This node is useful for scenarios where multiple textual descriptions need to be encoded in parallel and then utilized for further processing or generation tasks.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip` (Required): The CLIP model used for encoding the text inputs. It is crucial for the text encoding process, affecting the quality and relevance of the generated conditionings. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `inputs_len` (Required): Specifies the number of text inputs to encode. It determines the iteration count for the encoding process, directly influencing the output list's length. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: A list of encoded text inputs, each transformed into a conditioning format suitable for further processing or generation tasks. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
