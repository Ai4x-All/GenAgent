- `Image Blend by Mask`: The Image Blend by Mask node is designed to blend two images together based on a mask and a specified blend percentage. It allows for the creation of composite images by selectively blending parts of two input images according to the mask's pattern, offering a high degree of control over the blending process.
    - Inputs:
        - `image_a` (Required): The first image to be blended. It serves as the base layer in the blending operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_b` (Required): The second image to be blended. It is combined with the first image according to the mask and blend percentage. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask` (Required): A mask image that determines the blending pattern. Areas in white allow the second image to show through, while black areas retain the first image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `blend_percentage` (Required): A float value that specifies the percentage of blending between the two images. A higher value increases the visibility of the second image in the blended result. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting image after blending the two input images based on the mask and blend percentage. Type should be `IMAGE`.
