- `Float To Floats (mtb)`: This node serves as a conversion utility designed to transform a single floating-point number into a tuple of floating-point numbers, facilitating compatibility with other extensions that use a list format to represent multiple float values.
    - Inputs:
        - `float` (Required): The single floating-point number to be converted into a tuple. This input is essential for the node's operation, enabling the conversion from a singular float value to a list format. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `floats`: The tuple of floating-point numbers resulting from the conversion of the input single float. This output facilitates compatibility with other extensions requiring a list format. Type should be `FLOATS`.
