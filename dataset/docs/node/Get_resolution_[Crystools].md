- `Get resolution [Crystools]`: This node is designed to determine the resolution of an image, providing a straightforward way to extract and utilize image dimensions within a workflow. It abstracts the complexity of handling image data structures, offering a simple interface to retrieve width and height information.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The image for which the resolution is to be determined. It plays a crucial role in the node's operation by serving as the primary data from which dimensions are extracted. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `width`: The width of the image in pixels. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The height of the image in pixels. Type should be `INT`.
