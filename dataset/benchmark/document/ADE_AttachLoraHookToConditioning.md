- `ADE_AttachLoraHookToConditioning`: This node is designed to attach LoRA hooks to conditioning data, enabling the dynamic modification of model behavior based on specified LoRA hooks. It plays a crucial role in customizing and controlling the conditioning process in generative models, particularly in the context of animation and differential rendering.
    - Inputs:
        - `conditioning` (Required): The conditioning data to which the LoRA hook will be attached. This data dictates the model's behavior and output, and attaching a LoRA hook allows for dynamic adjustments. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `lora_hook` (Required): The LoRA hook to be attached to the conditioning data. This hook enables the modification of model parameters at runtime, allowing for enhanced control and customization of the generative process. Type should be `LORA_HOOK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: The modified conditioning data with the LoRA hook attached, enabling dynamic adjustments to the model's behavior. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
