- `FromListGetModels`: The node is designed to extract a single model from a list of models based on a specified index. It enables selective retrieval of models from a collection, facilitating operations that require individual model processing.
    - Inputs:
        - `list` (Required): The list of models from which a single model is to be retrieved. This parameter is crucial for specifying the source collection of models. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The model extracted from the specified index of the input list. This output is significant for subsequent operations that require a specific model. Type should be `MODEL`.
