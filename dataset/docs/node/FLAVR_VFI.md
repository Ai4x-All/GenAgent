- `FLAVR VFI`: The FLAVR_VFI node specializes in video frame interpolation, specifically designed to enhance video quality by interpolating frames to achieve a smoother motion at a 2x rate. It emphasizes the use of the FLAVR model for generating intermediate frames in a video sequence, ensuring a more fluid and visually appealing playback experience.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: The checkpoint name for loading the specific pretrained FLAVR model, facilitating the use of trained weights for interpolation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clear_cache_after_n_frames`: Specifies the number of frames processed before clearing the CUDA cache to prevent memory overflow. Type should be `INT`.
        - `multiplier`: Specifies the interpolation rate, with a strong recommendation for a 2x rate to align with FLAVR's optimal performance capabilities. Type should be `INT`.
        - `duplicate_first_last_frames`: Indicates whether to duplicate the first and last frames in the output, potentially enhancing the visual continuity of the interpolated video. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `frames`: The input video frames to be interpolated. These frames are processed to generate intermediate frames, enhancing the video's smoothness. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `optional_interpolation_states`: Optional states that can be used to influence the interpolation process, providing flexibility in handling various video processing scenarios. Type should be `INTERPOLATION_STATES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The interpolated frames produced by the FLAVR model, resulting in a smoother and more visually appealing video sequence. Type should be `IMAGE`.
