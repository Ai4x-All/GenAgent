- `ImageDrawPiesliceByContainer`: This node is designed to draw pie slice shapes on images within specified containers. It leverages the dimensions of the container to accurately position and scale the pie slice, allowing for detailed customization of the slice's appearance including its outline and fill colors, size, and angle.
    - Parameters:
        - `start_x`: The starting x-coordinate for the pie slice within the container. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_y`: The starting y-coordinate for the pie slice within the container. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_x`: The ending x-coordinate for the pie slice, defining its width. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_y`: The ending y-coordinate for the pie slice, defining its height. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start`: The starting angle of the pie slice in degrees. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end`: The ending angle of the pie slice in degrees. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_size`: The thickness of the pie slice's outline. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_red`: The red component of the outline's color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_green`: The green component of the outline's color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_blue`: The blue component of the outline's color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_alpha`: The alpha (transparency) component of the outline's color. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `fill_red`: The red component of the pie slice's fill color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_green`: The green component of the pie slice's fill color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_blue`: The blue component of the pie slice's fill color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_alpha`: The alpha (transparency) component of the pie slice's fill color. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `SSAA`: Super-sampling anti-aliasing factor for smoother edges. Type should be `INT`.
        - `method`: The method used for drawing the pie slice, affecting rendering quality and performance. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `container`: The image container where the pie slice will be drawn. It defines the spatial context for the drawing operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The modified image container with the pie slice drawn onto it. Type should be `IMAGE`.
