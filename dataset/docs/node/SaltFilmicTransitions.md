- `SaltFilmicTransitions`: The SaltFilmicTransitions node is designed to create visually appealing transitions between two sets of images, utilizing a variety of modes such as swipes and circle expansions. It allows for dynamic visual storytelling by seamlessly blending images together over a specified number of frames, with optional control over the transition's smoothness through a mask blur schedule.
    - Parameters:
        - `mode`: Specifies the style of the transition, such as swipe directions or circle expansions, defining the visual effect used to blend the images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `transition_frames`: The number of frames over which the transition occurs, determining the duration and smoothness of the effect. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images_a`: The first set of images to transition from. These images serve as the starting point for the transition effect. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `images_b`: The second set of images to transition to. These images serve as the destination for the transition effect. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask_blur_schedule`: An optional schedule to control the blur intensity over the transition, allowing for finer visual tuning of the transition effect. Type should be `LIST`.
    - Outputs:
        - `images`: The resulting set of images after applying the transition effect, blended according to the specified mode and parameters. Type should be `IMAGE`.
