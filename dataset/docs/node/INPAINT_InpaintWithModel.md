- `INPAINT_InpaintWithModel`: This node is designed to perform inpainting on images using a specified inpainting model. It takes an image and a mask as inputs, along with the inpainting model, and applies the model to the regions specified by the mask to fill in or correct missing or undesired parts of the image. Optionally, it can also upscale the inpainted image using an additional model for higher resolution output.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: A seed value for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the inpainting process. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `inpaint_model`: The inpainting model to be used for the inpainting process. This model dictates the technique and quality of the inpainting. Type should be `INPAINT_MODEL`.
        - `image`: The image to be inpainted. This is the target image where missing or undesired areas are to be filled in. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: A mask indicating the areas of the image to be inpainted. Areas marked in the mask are the ones the inpainting model will focus on. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `optional_upscale_model`: An optional model for upscaling the inpainted image, allowing for higher resolution outputs if desired. Type should be `UPSCALE_MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The result of the inpainting process, which is the original image with the specified areas inpainted. Optionally, this image may also be upscaled if an upscale model was provided. Type should be `IMAGE`.
