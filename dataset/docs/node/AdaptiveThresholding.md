- `AdaptiveThresholding`: The AdaptiveThresholding node applies adaptive thresholding techniques to images, converting them from grayscale to binary images based on local image characteristics. This process enhances the visibility of features in various lighting conditions, making it suitable for preprocessing images in computer vision tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `max_value`: The maximum intensity value that a pixel can have after thresholding. It determines the brightness of the white regions in the output binary image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `adaptive_method`: Specifies the method used for calculating the threshold for a pixel based on the pixel values in its neighborhood. It affects the adaptiveness of the thresholding process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `threshold_type`: Determines whether the pixel value is set to the maximum value or zero, based on the comparison with the threshold. It influences the binary outcome of the thresholding. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `block_size`: The size of the neighborhood area used to calculate the threshold for each pixel. It impacts the granularity of the thresholding. Type should be `INT`.
        - `c`: A constant subtracted from the mean or weighted mean calculated. It fine-tunes the thresholding by adjusting the threshold value. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `src`: The source image to be thresholded. It is crucial for defining the input image on which adaptive thresholding will be applied. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The binary image resulting from the adaptive thresholding process. It highlights the features of interest in the image by converting it into a binary format. Type should be `IMAGE`.
