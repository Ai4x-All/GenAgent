- `ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettings`: This node is designed to configure motion model settings for the AnimateDiff process, allowing users to fine-tune the motion scale parameters to achieve desired animation effects.
    - Parameters:
        - `pe_strength`: Determines the strength of positional encoding adjustments, influencing the animation's spatial dynamics. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attn_strength`: Controls the strength of attention adjustments, affecting the focus and detail of animated elements. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `other_strength`: Adjusts the strength of other model parameters, offering additional customization of the animation effects. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `motion_pe_stretch`: Specifies the extent to which positional encoding is stretched, altering the motion's temporal scale. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cap_initial_pe_length`: Caps the initial positional encoding length, setting a limit on the starting scale of motion. Type should be `INT`.
        - `interpolate_pe_to_length`: Defines the target length for positional encoding interpolation, impacting the animation's smoothness and flow. Type should be `INT`.
        - `initial_pe_idx_offset`: Sets the initial positional encoding index offset, adjusting the starting point of the animation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `final_pe_idx_offset`: Determines the final positional encoding index offset, influencing the animation's end point. Type should be `INT`.
        - `min_motion_scale`: Sets the minimum scale for motion, ensuring animations do not scale down below this threshold. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `max_motion_scale`: Defines the maximum scale for motion, capping the intensity of animation effects. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `mask_motion_scale`: Applies a mask to scale motion selectively across different parts of the image, enhancing the animation's realism and complexity. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `ad_settings`: Outputs the configured motion model settings, encapsulating the adjustments made to motion scale parameters. Type should be `AD_SETTINGS`.
