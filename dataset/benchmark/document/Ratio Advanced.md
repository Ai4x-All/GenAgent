        - `select_target_ratio` (Required): Selects a target ratio for the final image, influencing its aspect ratio and overall appearance. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `target_w` (Required): Specifies a custom width for the target image, allowing for detailed control over its dimensions. Type should be `INT`.
        - `target_h` (Required): Specifies a custom height for the target image, allowing for detailed control over its dimensions. Type should be `INT`.
        - `target_mult` (Required): Applies a multiplier to the target image dimensions, facilitating dynamic adjustments to its size. Type should be `FLOAT`.
