- `Inference_Core_SAMPreprocessor`: The SAM Preprocessor node is designed for segmenting images using the SAM (Segment Anything Model) architecture. It leverages a pretrained SAM model to process images, adjusting their resolution as needed, and returns the segmented output.
    - Parameters:
        - `resolution`: Specifies the resolution to which the input image should be scaled before segmentation. This affects the granularity and quality of the segmentation output. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be segmented. This is the primary data the SAM Preprocessor operates on, determining the areas of interest within the image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The segmented version of the input image, highlighting different regions as determined by the SAM model. Type should be `IMAGE`.
