- `CrossFadeImages`: The CrossFadeImages node is designed to blend two sequences of images together over a specified number of frames, using a variety of easing functions to control the transition dynamics. This node allows for the creation of smooth transitions between images, enhancing visual storytelling or creating dynamic visual effects.
    - Parameters:
        - `interpolation`: Specifies the easing function to be used for the transition, affecting how the crossfade between images progresses over time. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `transition_start_index`: The index in the image sequences where the transition begins, allowing for precise control over the timing of the crossfade. Type should be `INT`.
        - `transitioning_frames`: The number of frames over which the transition occurs, defining the length of the crossfade effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_level`: The initial alpha value for the crossfade, determining the starting blend ratio between the two image sequences. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_level`: The final alpha value for the crossfade, determining the ending blend ratio between the two image sequences. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images_i`: unknown Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting sequence of images after applying the crossfade transition between the two input sequences. Type should be `IMAGE`.
