- `XY Input_ LoRA Stacks`: This node is designed to process and visualize XY plot data specifically for LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) stacks, enabling the analysis and comparison of different LoRA configurations and their impacts on model efficiency and performance.
    - Inputs:
        - `node_state` (Required): Indicates whether the node is active or not, affecting whether the LoRA stacks are processed for XY plotting. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lora_stack_i` (Optional): Represents a LoRA stack configuration to be included in the XY plot analysis. The index 'i' can range from 1 to 5, allowing for multiple LoRA stack configurations to be analyzed. Type should be `LORA_STACK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `X or Y`: Outputs the XY plot data for the given LoRA stacks, facilitating visualization and comparison. The output can represent either 'X' or 'Y' data based on the processing of LoRA stacks. Type should be `XY`.
