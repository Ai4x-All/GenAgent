- `To Device (mtb)`: The ToDevice node is designed to transfer image or mask tensors to a specified computing device, such as CPU, GPU, or MPS (Apple Silicon), facilitating the manipulation of tensor data across different hardware platforms.
    - Parameters:
        - `ignore_errors`: Determines whether to proceed without throwing an error when both image and mask inputs are absent, allowing for flexible error handling. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `device`: Specifies the computing device to which the image or mask tensor will be transferred, supporting dynamic selection based on available hardware. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The image tensor to be transferred to the specified device, enabling hardware-specific tensor operations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: The mask tensor to be transferred to the specified device, similar to the image tensor, for hardware-accelerated processing. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `images`: The image tensor after being transferred to the specified device. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `masks`: The mask tensor after being transferred to the specified device. Type should be `MASK`.
