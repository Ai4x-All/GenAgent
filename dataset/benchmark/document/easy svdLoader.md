- `easy svdLoader`: The `easy svdLoader` node is designed to facilitate the loading of SVD (Singular Value Decomposition) models into the system. It streamlines the process of identifying and retrieving SVD model files from a specified directory, ensuring that only relevant files are selected for further processing. This node plays a crucial role in simplifying the integration and utilization of SVD models within the broader computational framework, making it easier for users to leverage SVD-based functionalities.
    - Inputs:
        - `ckpt_name` (Required): The `ckpt_name` parameter specifies the checkpoint name for the SVD model to be loaded. It is crucial for identifying the specific model file to be used in the loading process, thereby enabling the precise application of SVD models within the system. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `vae_name` (Required): The `vae_name` parameter identifies the VAE model to be used alongside the SVD model, facilitating a combined application of these models for enhanced processing capabilities. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clip_name` (Required): The `clip_name` parameter specifies the CLIP model to be used in conjunction with the SVD model, enabling advanced feature extraction and analysis. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `init_image` (Required): The `init_image` parameter is used to provide an initial image for processing, serving as a starting point for model applications. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `resolution` (Required): The `resolution` parameter specifies the desired resolution for the output, impacting the quality and size of the generated content. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `empty_latent_width` (Required): Specifies the width of the empty latent space to be used, affecting the dimensions of the generated content. Type should be `INT`.
        - `empty_latent_height` (Required): Specifies the height of the empty latent space, influencing the vertical dimension of the generated content. Type should be `INT`.
        - `video_frames` (Required): Determines the number of frames for video generation, directly affecting the video's length. Type should be `INT`.
        - `motion_bucket_id` (Required): Identifies the motion bucket to be used, influencing the motion characteristics of the generated video. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fps` (Required): Sets the frames per second for the video, impacting the playback speed and smoothness. Type should be `INT`.
        - `augmentation_level` (Required): Controls the level of augmentation applied, affecting the variety and intensity of visual modifications. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `optional_positive` (Optional): Optional positive conditioning text to guide the generation towards specific attributes. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `optional_negative` (Optional): Optional negative conditioning text to steer the generation away from certain attributes. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The `pipe` output represents the pipeline configuration resulting from the loaded models, integrating SVD, VAE, and possibly other models. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model`: The `model` output refers to the specific SVD model that has been loaded and is ready for use within the pipeline. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `vae`: The `vae` output indicates the VAE model that has been loaded and integrated into the system for combined use with the SVD model. Type should be `VAE`.
