- `easy XYInputsï€º Lora`: This node facilitates the dynamic selection and manipulation of LORA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models for generating or modifying XY input values. It allows users to specify various parameters such as model and clip strengths, and optionally stack multiple LORA configurations for advanced customization.
    - Parameters:
        - `input_mode`: Defines the mode of input, such as whether weights are included with Lora names, affecting how LORA models are selected and utilized. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lora_count`: Specifies the number of LORA models to consider, enabling dynamic adjustment based on user requirements. Type should be `INT`.
        - `model_strength`: Determines the strength of the model's influence, allowing for fine-tuning of the LORA model's impact. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `clip_strength`: Sets the strength of the clipping operation, offering control over the extent of clipping applied to the LORA model. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `lora_name_i`: Specifies the name of a LORA model to be considered in the stack, enabling targeted selection of LORA configurations. The index 'i' ranges from 1 to the number specified by 'lora_count', allowing for multiple LORA models to be specified. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `model_str_i`: Determines the model strength for a specified LORA model, allowing for precise control over its influence. The index 'i' corresponds to the LORA model specified by 'lora_name_i'. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `clip_str_i`: Sets the clip strength for a specified LORA model, providing customization of the clipping effect. The index 'i' corresponds to the LORA model specified by 'lora_name_i'. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `optional_lora_stack`: Allows for the inclusion of an existing stack of LORA configurations, providing flexibility in extending or modifying LORA setups. Type should be `LORA_STACK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `X or Y`: Outputs the generated or modified XY input values, ready for application or further processing. Type should be `X_Y`.
