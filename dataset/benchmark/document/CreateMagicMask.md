- `CreateMagicMask`: This node specializes in generating dynamic masks based on a combination of parameters such as frames, transitions, depth, distortion, and seed. It is designed to create visually complex and customizable masks for use in various multimedia applications, offering a unique way to enhance visual content with magical or mystical effects.
    - Inputs:
        - `frames` (Required): Specifies the number of frames for the mask animation, affecting the length and fluidity of the generated mask sequence. Type should be `INT`.
        - `depth` (Required): Determines the perceived depth of the mask, adding a sense of three-dimensionality to the generated visual effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `distortion` (Required): Controls the level of distortion applied to the mask, allowing for the creation of more abstract or surreal visual effects. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `seed` (Required): Sets a seed value for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the mask patterns. Type should be `INT`.
        - `transitions` (Required): Defines the types and characteristics of transitions between mask frames, contributing to the visual complexity and dynamism of the mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `frame_width` (Required): Specifies the width of each frame in the mask animation, defining the horizontal dimension of the generated masks. Type should be `INT`.
        - `frame_height` (Required): Specifies the height of each frame in the mask animation, defining the vertical dimension of the generated masks. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The primary output mask generated by the node, offering a dynamic visual effect based on the input parameters. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask_inverted`: An inverted version of the primary mask, providing an alternative visual effect that can be used in various applications. Type should be `MASK`.
