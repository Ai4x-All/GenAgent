- `BuildColorRangeAdvanced (hsv)`: The BuildColorRangeAdvanced (hsv) node is designed to create a comprehensive range of colors in the HSV color space. It leverages advanced techniques to accurately define and adjust the boundaries of color ranges, ensuring precise color selection and manipulation for various computer vision tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `hue_exp`: The 'hue_exp' parameter is expected to adjust the hue component of the color range, affecting the final color selection. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `sat_exp`: The 'sat_exp' parameter is expected to adjust the saturation component of the color range, affecting the final color selection. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `val_exp`: The 'val_exp' parameter is expected to adjust the value component of the color range, affecting the final color selection. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `samples`: The 'samples' parameter represents the data points or color samples in the HSV color space that the node will use to determine the range. It is crucial for defining the scope of the color range to be generated. Type should be `HSV_SAMPLES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `hsv_color`: The 'hsv_color' output represents the generated color range in the HSV color space. It is essential for applications requiring precise color manipulation and selection. Type should be `HSV_COLOR`.
        - `combo[string]`: The 'combo[string]' output provides additional information or metadata about the generated color range, enhancing the node's utility in complex color analysis tasks. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
