- `Inference_Core_LayeredDiffusionDiffApply`: This node specializes in applying a layered diffusion process to a given model, leveraging specific configurations and weights to modify the model's behavior. It is designed to enhance or alter the model's output by integrating diffusion techniques, which can include attention sharing mechanisms if supported by the model configuration.
    - Parameters:
        - `config`: A string specifying the configuration to use for the layered diffusion process. This configuration determines how the diffusion is applied, including any model-specific adjustments or optimizations. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `weight`: A float value that influences the intensity of the diffusion process applied to the model. It adjusts how significantly the diffusion alters the model's behavior or output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model to which the layered diffusion process will be applied. This parameter is crucial as it determines the base model that will undergo the diffusion process, affecting the final output. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `cond`: The conditional input for the diffusion process, which guides the diffusion direction and outcome. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `uncond`: The unconditional input for the diffusion process, providing a baseline for the diffusion effect. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `blended_latent`: A latent representation that combines aspects of both conditional and unconditional inputs, used to influence the diffusion process. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `latent`: The original latent representation of the model before the diffusion process is applied. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The modified model after the layered diffusion process has been applied, reflecting changes in behavior or output. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `conditioning`: The conditioning information used or generated during the diffusion process, which can influence the model's output. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
