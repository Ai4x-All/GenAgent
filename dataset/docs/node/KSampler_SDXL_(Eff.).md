- `KSampler SDXL (Eff.)`: The KSampler SDXL (Eff.) node is designed for efficient sampling in the context of generative models, specifically tailored for handling Stable Diffusion XL models. It extends the capabilities of regular and advanced KSampler nodes by incorporating specialized sampling strategies that accommodate the unique requirements of SDXL models, such as handling larger model sizes and optimizing for performance without compromising on the quality of generated samples.

        - `scheduler`: Determines the scheduling strategy for the sampling process, impacting the progression and quality of image generation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_at_step`: Defines the starting step for the sampling process, allowing for the continuation or refinement of previously generated samples. Type should be `INT`.
        - `refine_at_step`: Specifies the step at which refinement operations are to be applied, enhancing the detail and quality of the generated images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `preview_method`: Indicates the method used for generating previews of the samples during the sampling process, aiding in the evaluation and adjustment of parameters. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `vae_decode`: A flag indicating whether the VAE decoder should be used to transform the latent representation back into image space, affecting the final output quality. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `sdxl_tuple`: Represents the model parameters and configurations specific to Stable Diffusion XL, serving as the primary input for the sampling process. It is crucial for defining the behavior and performance of the sampling operation. Type should be `SDXL_TUPLE`.
