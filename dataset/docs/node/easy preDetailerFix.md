- `easy preDetailerFix`: The 'easy preDetailerFix' node is designed to enhance and refine the details of images before further processing or final output. It operates within a pipeline to adjust and optimize image characteristics, such as resolution and detail sharpness, based on predefined or custom settings.
    - Parameters:
        - `guide_size`: Determines the target size for guiding the detail enhancement process, influencing the granularity of details. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `guide_size_for`: A boolean flag indicating whether the guide size is applied to bounding boxes or the crop region, affecting the focus area of detail enhancement. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `max_size`: Sets the maximum size limit for the images being processed, ensuring they do not exceed a specified resolution. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `seed`: Provides a seed value for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the detailing process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Specifies the number of steps to be taken in the detailing process, affecting the depth of detail enhancement. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Controls the configuration setting for the detailing process, influencing the intensity of detail enhancement. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Selects the sampler to be used in the detailing process, affecting the method of detail generation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Chooses the scheduler for the detailing process, determining the sequence and timing of operations. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: Adjusts the level of denoising applied to the images, balancing between detail preservation and noise reduction. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `feather`: Sets the feathering amount applied to the edges of the images, smoothing transitions for a more natural look. Type should be `INT`.
        - `noise_mask`: Specifies the noise mask settings, affecting the application of noise in the detailing process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `force_inpaint`: Indicates whether inpainting is forcefully applied, affecting the handling of missing or damaged areas in images. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `drop_size`: Determines the size of drops used in the process, influencing the detailing effect on the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `wildcard`: Provides a wildcard input for custom settings or parameters, offering flexibility in the detailing process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `cycle`: Specifies the number of cycles the detailing process is repeated, affecting the thoroughness of enhancement. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Specifies the pipeline configuration for image processing, affecting how images are detailed and enhanced. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `bbox_segm_pipe`: Defines the pipeline settings for bounding box and segmentation, influencing the detail enhancement based on object detection. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `sam_pipe`: Specifies the SAM pipeline configuration, affecting the selective attention model used in detailing. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `optional_image`: Allows for an optional image input, providing additional context or reference for the detailing process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: Outputs the modified pipeline configuration after the detailing process, reflecting the applied enhancements and adjustments. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
