- `FILM VFI`: The FILM VFI node specializes in frame interpolation, leveraging deep learning models to generate intermediate frames between two given images. It aims to enhance video fluidity and detail by accurately predicting and synthesizing frames that could logically exist between the original frames, thus achieving smoother motion transitions and improved visual quality.
    - Inputs:
        - `ckpt_name` (Required): Specifies the checkpoint name for the FILM VFI model, determining the specific pretrained model weights to be used for frame interpolation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `frames` (Required): The sequence of images to be interpolated, serving as the input frames for generating intermediate frames. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `clear_cache_after_n_frames` (Required): Controls how often the system's cache is cleared during the interpolation process to manage memory usage effectively. Type should be `INT`.
        - `multiplier` (Required): Defines the number of intermediate frames to be generated between each pair of input frames, affecting the smoothness of the output video. Type should be `INT`.
        - `optional_interpolation_states` (Optional): Optional states that can influence the frame skipping logic during interpolation, allowing for more customized processing. Type should be `INTERPOLATION_STATES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output images generated by the FILM VFI model, representing the interpolated frames that enhance the fluidity and detail of the original video sequence. Type should be `IMAGE`.
