- `Logic Boolean`: The Logic Boolean node is designed to process boolean inputs, performing basic logical operations or conversions based on the specified function. It abstracts the complexity of boolean logic into simple, reusable components that can be integrated into larger workflows, facilitating decision-making processes and data flow control.
    - Inputs:
        - `boolean_number` (Required): The boolean_number input parameter is crucial for determining the operation's outcome, serving as the primary data upon which logical operations or conversions are performed. Its value directly influences the node's execution and results. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `number`: The number output represents the numerical result of the logical operation or conversion performed, encapsulating the outcome in a numerical format. Type should be `NUMBER`.
        - `int`: The int output provides an integer representation of the logical operation or conversion result, further specifying the numerical outcome. Type should be `INT`.
