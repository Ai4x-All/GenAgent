- `SaltKeyframeSchedulerBFN`: This node is designed for scheduling keyframe animations with customizable easing functions. It allows for the precise timing and sequencing of animations by specifying keyframes, easing modes, and optional parameters to fine-tune the animation's progression.
    - Parameters:
        - `keyframe_schedule`: Defines the sequence of keyframes for the animation. It's the backbone of the scheduling process, dictating the timing and values of the animation frames. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `easing_mode`: Specifies the easing function to apply between keyframes, influencing the animation's pace and style. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `end_frame`: Determines the last frame of the animation, allowing for the animation's duration to be limited. Type should be `INT`.
        - `ndigits`: Sets the precision of the computed keyframe values, affecting the smoothness and accuracy of the animation. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `a`: Custom variable 'a' for additional flexibility in defining the animation, supporting complex scheduling scenarios. Type should be `*`.
        - `b`: Custom variable 'b' for additional flexibility in defining the animation, supporting complex scheduling scenarios. Type should be `*`.
        - `c`: Custom variable 'c', extending the flexibility and complexity of animation scheduling. Type should be `*`.
        - `d`: Custom variable 'd', further enhancing the scheduling capabilities with additional customization options. Type should be `*`.
        - `e`: Custom variable 'e', adds another layer of customization for intricate animation scheduling. Type should be `*`.
        - `f`: Custom variable 'f', allows for even more detailed control over the animation's scheduling. Type should be `*`.
        - `g`: Custom variable 'g', contributes to the depth of customization available for scheduling animations. Type should be `*`.
        - `h`: Custom variable 'h', completes the extensive set of customization options for detailed animation scheduling. Type should be `*`.
    - Outputs:
        - `schedule_list`: The computed schedule list of keyframe values, ready for use in animating objects or scenes. Type should be `LIST`.
