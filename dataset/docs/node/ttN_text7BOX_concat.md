- `ttN text7BOX_concat`: The node is designed to concatenate up to seven text inputs into a single string, using a specified delimiter to separate each text input. This functionality allows for flexible text manipulation and aggregation, catering to scenarios where multiple pieces of text need to be combined in a structured manner.
    - Parameters:
        - `text1`: The first text input to be concatenated. It plays a foundational role in the concatenation process, serving as the starting point for the combined output. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text2`: The second text input to be concatenated. It adds to the sequence of texts being merged, following the first input. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text3`: The third text input to be concatenated. It continues the sequence of texts being merged, adding further content after the second input. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text4`: The fourth text input to be concatenated. It extends the sequence of texts, adding additional content to the combined output. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text5`: The fifth text input to be concatenated. It further extends the sequence of texts, enriching the combined output with more content. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text6`: The sixth text input to be concatenated. It adds depth to the combined output, contributing additional content to the sequence. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text7`: The seventh and final text input to be concatenated. It completes the sequence of texts, finalizing the content of the combined output. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `delimiter`: Specifies the character or sequence of characters used to separate each text input in the concatenated output. This parameter allows for customization of the output format. Type should be `STRING`.
