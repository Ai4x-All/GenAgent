- `DistanceTransform`: The DistanceTransform node applies a distance transform to a binary image, converting it into a grayscale image where each pixel's intensity represents its distance to the nearest background pixel. It supports various distance types and mask sizes, allowing for customization of the distance calculation.
    - Inputs:
        - `binary_image` (Required): The binary image to which the distance transform will be applied. It is crucial for identifying foreground and background pixels for distance calculations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `distance_type` (Required): Specifies the type of distance calculation to use, such as Euclidean (L2), Manhattan (L1), or Chebyshev (C). It affects the way distances are computed in the image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `mask_size` (Required): Determines the size of the mask used in the distance calculation, affecting the precision and computational cost of the transform. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output grayscale image where pixel intensities represent distances to the nearest background pixel. Type should be `IMAGE`.
