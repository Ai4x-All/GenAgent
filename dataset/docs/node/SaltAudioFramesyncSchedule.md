- `SaltAudioFramesyncSchedule`: The SaltAudioFramesyncSchedule node is designed to synchronize audio with visual elements by scheduling frames based on audio analysis. It facilitates the creation of audio-visual content by aligning keyframes with specific audio cues, enabling dynamic visual effects that are in harmony with the audio track.
    - Parameters:
        - `amp_control`: Controls the amplitude sensitivity of the audio analysis, affecting how audio levels influence the frame scheduling. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `amp_offset`: An offset value for the amplitude, allowing for fine-tuning of the frame scheduling in relation to the audio amplitude. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `frame_rate`: The frame rate at which the visual elements will be synchronized with the audio, determining the timing precision of the synchronization. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_frame`: The starting frame for the synchronization schedule, enabling targeted synchronization within a specific segment of the audio-visual content. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_frame`: The ending frame for the synchronization schedule, defining the scope of the audio-visual synchronization. Type should be `INT`.
        - `curves_mode`: Specifies the easing function to be used for the amplitude control, influencing the dynamic response of the visual effects to the audio. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `frequency_low`: The lower bound of the frequency range to be considered for the audio analysis, affecting the selection of audio content that influences the frame scheduling. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `frequency_high`: The upper bound of the frequency range to be considered for the audio analysis, affecting the selection of audio content that influences the frame scheduling. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `audio`: The audio input for which the frame synchronization schedule will be generated. It is crucial for determining the timing and dynamics of the visual effects in relation to the audio. Type should be `AUDIO`.
    - Outputs:
        - `left_low_schedule`: The scheduled frames for the low frequency range of the left audio channel. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `left_mid_schedule`: The scheduled frames for the mid frequency range of the left audio channel. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `left_high_schedule`: The scheduled frames for the high frequency range of the left audio channel. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `right_low_schedule`: The scheduled frames for the low frequency range of the right audio channel. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `right_mid_schedule`: The scheduled frames for the mid frequency range of the right audio channel. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `right_high_schedule`: The scheduled frames for the high frequency range of the right audio channel. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `average_low`: The average frame scheduling for the low frequency range across both audio channels. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `average_mid`: The average frame scheduling for the mid frequency range across both audio channels. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `average_high`: The average frame scheduling for the high frequency range across both audio channels. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `average_schedule`: The overall average frame scheduling across all frequency ranges and channels. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `frame_count`: The total count of frames scheduled. Type should be `INT`.
        - `frame_rate`: The frame rate used for scheduling. Type should be `INT`.
