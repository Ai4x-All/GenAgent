- `IG Int`: The IG Int node is designed to encapsulate and handle integer values within a node-based programming environment. It allows for the specification of an integer value, providing a straightforward way to work with integers in a visual programming context.
    - Inputs:
        - `value` (Required): Specifies the integer value to be used or manipulated by the node. This parameter is central to the node's operation, serving as the primary input that determines the node's output. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `int`: Outputs the integer value specified by the input parameter, effectively passing the value through the node. Type should be `INT`.
