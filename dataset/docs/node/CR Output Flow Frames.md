- `CR Output Flow Frames`: This node is designed for saving sequences of animation frames, facilitating the output process in animation workflows by streamlining the saving of image sequences.
    - Parameters:
        - `output_folder`: Specifies the directory where the output animation frames will be saved. It is essential for defining the destination of the saved frames. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `filename_prefix`: A prefix added to the filename of each saved frame, aiding in the organization and identification of the output files. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `current_frame`: Indicates the index of the current frame being processed. This is vital for tracking the progress of the frame saving operation and for naming the output files appropriately. Type should be `INT`.
        - `output_path`: The path where the final image will be saved. This parameter is crucial for directing the output to the correct location. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `current_image`: Represents the current image frame to be saved. It is crucial for determining the specific frame that will be output at any given iteration. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `interpolated_img`: An optional parameter for providing an interpolated image frame that can be saved alongside the current frame, offering flexibility in outputting enhanced or modified frames. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
