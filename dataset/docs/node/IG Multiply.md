- `IG Multiply`: The IG Multiply node performs multiplication of two floating-point values, providing a straightforward way to compute the product of two numbers within a graphical programming environment.
    - Parameters:
        - `Value_A`: Specifies the first floating-point value to be multiplied. Its range is virtually unlimited, allowing for a wide variety of numerical inputs. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `Value_B`: Determines the second floating-point value to be multiplied. Similar to Value_A, it supports a broad range of numerical inputs, enabling diverse multiplication scenarios. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `float`: The result of multiplying the input values Value_A and Value_B, returned as a floating-point number. Type should be `FLOAT`.
