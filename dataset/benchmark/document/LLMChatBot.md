- `LLMChatBot`: The LLMChatBot node is designed to facilitate interactive chat sessions using large language models (LLMs). It dynamically generates responses based on user inputs, context, and optionally, a set of documents to enrich the conversation. This node leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to understand and engage in human-like dialogue, making it suitable for applications requiring conversational AI capabilities.
    - Inputs:
        - `llm_model` (Required): A dictionary specifying the large language model to be used for the chat session. It includes configurations such as the embedding model and the main language model itself, which are crucial for generating responses. Type should be `LLM_MODEL`.
        - `llm_context` (Required): An optional context that can be provided to tailor the chat session's environment, influencing how responses are generated by the model. Type should be `LLM_CONTEXT`.
        - `prompt` (Required): The user's input message to which the chatbot will respond. This is a key component in initiating the dialogue flow. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `reset_engine` (Optional): A flag to reset the chat engine, clearing any existing context or history to start a fresh conversation. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `user_nickname` (Optional): An optional nickname for the user, used to personalize the chat session. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `system_nickname` (Optional): An optional nickname for the system or chatbot, enhancing the conversational experience. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `char_per_token` (Optional): Defines the average number of characters per token, used for tokenization purposes in the chat session. Type should be `INT`.
        - `documents` (Optional): An optional list of documents that can be used to provide additional context or information for generating responses. Each document is structured to include text and potentially additional metadata. Type should be `DOCUMENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `chat_history`: A record of the chat session, including both user and system messages, maintained to provide context for the conversation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `response`: The generated response from the chatbot to the user's input, showcasing the chatbot's ability to engage in meaningful dialogue. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `chat_token_count`: The cumulative count of tokens used in the chat session, helping to monitor and manage the session's complexity. Type should be `INT`.
