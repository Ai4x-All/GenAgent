- `Qr Code (mtb)`: The MTB_QrCode node generates QR codes based on provided URLs, allowing customization of size, error correction level, and color inversion. It serves as a basic QR code generator with deprecation warnings, suggesting alternatives for more advanced needs.
    - Parameters:
        - `url`: The URL to be encoded into the QR code, serving as the primary data for the QR code generation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `width`: Specifies the width of the generated QR code image in pixels. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Specifies the height of the generated QR code image in pixels. Type should be `INT`.
        - `box_size`: The size of each box (or 'pixel') in the QR code grid. Type should be `INT`.
        - `border`: The width of the border around the QR code. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `error_correct`: Determines the error correction level used in the QR code, affecting its resilience to damage. Type should be `['L', 'M', 'Q', 'H']`.
        - `invert`: Whether the QR code's colors are inverted, swapping the foreground and background colors. Type should be `['BOOLEAN']`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The generated QR code as an image tensor, ready for further processing or display. Type should be `IMAGE`.
