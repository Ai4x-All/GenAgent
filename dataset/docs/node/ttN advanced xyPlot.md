- `ttN advanced xyPlot`: The ttN advanced xyPlot node is designed for advanced plotting capabilities, enabling the generation and manipulation of XY plots with enhanced features such as grid spacing, latent index consideration, and individual output control. It provides a framework for visualizing complex data relationships and patterns in a customizable manner.
    - Parameters:
        - `grid_spacing`: Specifies the spacing between points on the grid, affecting the density and separation of plotted points, thereby influencing the plot's granularity and overall appearance. Type should be `INT`.
        - `latent_index`: Identifies a specific latent dimension or index to be visualized, allowing for targeted exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data spaces. Type should be `INT`.
        - `output_individuals`: Controls whether individual data points are outputted separately, enabling detailed examination and analysis of each point within the plot. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `flip_xy`: Determines whether the x and y axes should be swapped, allowing for alternative perspectives and orientations of the plotted data. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `x_plot`: Provides the data points for the x-axis, forming one dimension of the plot's data representation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `y_plot`: Provides the data points for the y-axis, forming the other dimension of the plot's data representation. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `adv_xyPlot`: Outputs a dictionary containing the plot data, including x and y coordinates, grid spacing, latent index, and output control information, encapsulating the plot's comprehensive configuration. Type should be `ADV_XYPLOT`.
