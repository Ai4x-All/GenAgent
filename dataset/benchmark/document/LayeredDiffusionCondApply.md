- `LayeredDiffusionCondApply`: This node specializes in applying conditional layered diffusion processes to models, leveraging specific conditions to guide the diffusion process. It integrates conditional inputs with the model's latent space, facilitating targeted modifications and enhancements in the generated outputs.
    - Inputs:
        - `model` (Required): The model to which the layered diffusion process will be applied, encapsulating the necessary architecture and parameters for the diffusion to take place. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `cond` (Required): The conditional input that guides the diffusion process, influencing the direction and characteristics of the generated output. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `uncond` (Required): An unconditional input that serves as a baseline or reference for the diffusion process, providing a contrast to the conditional input. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent` (Required): The latent representation of the input, which is processed and integrated with the conditional and unconditional inputs during the diffusion process. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `config` (Required): A configuration string that specifies the particular layered diffusion model to use, aligning with the model's version and capabilities. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `weight` (Required): A weight factor that influences the extent to which the conditional input affects the diffusion process, allowing for fine-tuning of the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The modified model after the layered diffusion process, incorporating the conditional and unconditional inputs. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `conditioning`: The conditioning information used during the diffusion process, reflecting how the conditional inputs were integrated. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
