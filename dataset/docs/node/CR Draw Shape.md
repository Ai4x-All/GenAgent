- `CR Draw Shape`: The CR Draw Shape node is designed for drawing various geometric shapes on an image canvas. It supports a wide range of shapes including circles, ovals, diamonds, squares, triangles, hexagons, octagons, quarter circles, half circles, starbursts, stars, and crosses. This node allows for the customization of shape properties such as size, aspect ratio, and color, enabling the creation of complex graphics patterns.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: Specifies the width of the image canvas. It determines the horizontal dimension of the canvas where the shapes will be drawn, affecting the overall layout and size of the geometric patterns. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Specifies the height of the image canvas. It determines the vertical dimension of the canvas where the shapes will be drawn, affecting the overall layout and size of the geometric patterns. Type should be `INT`.
        - `shape`: Defines the type of geometric shape to be drawn on the canvas. The choice of shape affects the visual outcome and the complexity of the pattern created. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `shape_color`: Determines the color of the shape to be drawn. The color choice influences the visual appeal and contrast of the shape against the canvas background. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `back_color`: Specifies the background color of the image canvas. It sets the overall tone and mood of the image, providing a backdrop for the geometric shapes. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `x_offset`: Adjusts the horizontal position of the shape on the canvas. It allows for precise placement of the shape, enabling the creation of dynamic and varied patterns. Type should be `INT`.
        - `y_offset`: Adjusts the vertical position of the shape on the canvas. It allows for precise placement of the shape, enabling the creation of dynamic and varied patterns. Type should be `INT`.
        - `zoom`: Controls the scale of the shape relative to its original size. Zooming in or out can dramatically alter the visual impact of the shape on the canvas. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `rotation`: Specifies the rotation angle of the shape in degrees. Rotating the shape can add dynamism and complexity to the pattern. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `shape_color_hex`: Specifies the hexadecimal color code for the shape color, offering an alternative to the predefined color options. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `bg_color_hex`: Specifies the hexadecimal color code for the background color, offering an alternative to the predefined color options. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `IMAGE`: The output image with the drawn shapes. It showcases the visual result of applying geometric patterns to the canvas, highlighting the node's capability to create complex graphics. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `show_help`: Provides textual help or guidance related to the node's functionality or output. It can offer insights into the drawing process or tips for optimizing the use of the node. Type should be `STRING`.
