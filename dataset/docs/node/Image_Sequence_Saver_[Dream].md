- `Image Sequence Saver [Dream]`: The Image Sequence Saver node is designed to save individual frames of an animation sequence to disk, supporting various file formats and configurations. It allows for detailed control over the output naming convention, directory structure, and file format, facilitating the creation of organized and accessible animation frame libraries.
    - Parameters:
        - `directory_path`: The target directory path where the image file will be saved, allowing for organized storage of animation frames. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `prefix`: A prefix added to the filename of each saved image, aiding in the identification and organization of frames within the directory. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `digits`: The number of digits to use for zero-padding the frame number in the filename, ensuring a consistent file naming convention. Type should be `INT`.
        - `at_end`: Determines the behavior when the end of the animation sequence is reached, offering options to stop output, raise an error, or keep going. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `filetype`: Specifies the file format for the saved image, including options for PNG with or without embedded workflow information, and JPG. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `frame_counter`: Specifies the current frame in the animation sequence, used to determine the filename and whether the saving process should continue based on the 'at_end' parameter. Type should be `FRAME_COUNTER`.
        - `image`: The image to be saved for the current frame, representing a single snapshot in the animation sequence. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `sequence`: The updated animation sequence after saving the current frame, reflecting any changes or additions. Type should be `ANIMATION_SEQUENCE`.
        - `log_entry`: A log entry detailing the outcome of the save operation, including success messages or error information. Type should be `LOG_ENTRY`.
