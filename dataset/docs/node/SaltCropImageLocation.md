- `SaltCropImageLocation`: This node is designed to crop images based on specified locations, allowing for precise adjustments and modifications to image datasets. It focuses on enhancing or isolating specific areas within images for further processing or analysis.
    - Parameters:
        - `top`: Specifies the top boundary of the crop area. Adjusting this value alters the vertical starting point of the crop, enabling fine-tuned control over the cropped region. Type should be `INT`.
        - `left`: Defines the left boundary of the crop area. This parameter allows for precise horizontal positioning of the crop, affecting the area of the image that is retained. Type should be `INT`.
        - `right`: Sets the right boundary of the crop area, determining the horizontal extent of the cropped region. This value influences the width of the resulting cropped image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `bottom`: Indicates the bottom boundary of the crop area. This parameter affects the vertical extent of the crop, controlling the height of the cropped image. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The collection of images to be cropped. This parameter is central to the node's operation, as it determines the specific images that will undergo cropping based on the provided dimensions. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `crop_data_batch`: An optional batch of crop data that can be used to specify multiple crop regions for a set of images. This parameter enables batch processing of images with varying crop specifications. Type should be `CROP_DATA_BATCH`.
    - Outputs:
        - `images`: The resulting images after the cropping operation. This output is essential for further processing or analysis of the cropped areas. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `crop_data_batch`: A batch of crop data corresponding to the processed images. This output provides detailed information about the crop regions applied to each image, facilitating further manipulations or analyses. Type should be `CROP_DATA_BATCH`.
