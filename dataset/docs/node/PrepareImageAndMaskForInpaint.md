- `PrepareImageAndMaskForInpaint`: This node prepares an image and its corresponding mask for the inpainting process by applying various preprocessing steps such as resizing, blurring, and adjusting the mask to ensure it is properly aligned and formatted for inpainting algorithms.
    - Parameters:
        - `mask_blur`: An integer specifying the amount of blur to apply to the mask, which helps in smoothing the edges of the mask for a more natural inpainting result. Type should be `INT`.
        - `inpaint_masked`: A boolean indicating whether to inpaint the masked areas, guiding the inpainting process on which regions to focus. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `mask_padding`: An integer defining the padding around the mask, which is used to adjust the focus area of the inpainting process. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image tensor that needs inpainting, which is a crucial component for the inpainting process as it provides the visual context. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: The mask tensor indicating areas to inpaint, essential for identifying the regions within the image that require restoration or modification. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `inpaint_image`: The inpainted image after applying the inpainting algorithm, showcasing the restored or modified regions. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `inpaint_mask`: The processed mask after applying the specified preprocessing steps, ready for use in the inpainting process. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `overlay_image`: An image that combines the original and inpainted images, providing a visual comparison between them. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `crop_region`: The region of the image that was selected for inpainting, indicating the focus area of the process. Type should be `CROP_REGION`.
