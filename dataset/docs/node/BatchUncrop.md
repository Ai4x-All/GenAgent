- `BatchUncrop`: The BatchUncrop node is designed to reverse the cropping process on a batch of images. It takes original images and their cropped versions along with cropping metadata to reconstruct the original images with the cropped areas seamlessly integrated, adjusting for borders and scaling as necessary.
    - Parameters:
        - `border_blending`: Controls the blending of the borders during the uncropping process to ensure a seamless integration. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `crop_rescale`: Indicates whether the cropped images should be rescaled to their original size before uncropping. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `border_top`: Specifies whether to apply a top border during the uncropping process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `border_bottom`: Specifies whether to apply a bottom border during the uncropping process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `border_left`: Specifies whether to apply a left border during the uncropping process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `border_right`: Specifies whether to apply a right border during the uncropping process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `original_images`: Original images before cropping, used as a base for the uncropping process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `cropped_images`: Cropped images that need to be integrated back into the original images. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `bboxes`: Bounding boxes specifying the cropped areas in the original images. Type should be `BBOX`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The original images with the cropped areas seamlessly integrated. Type should be `IMAGE`.
