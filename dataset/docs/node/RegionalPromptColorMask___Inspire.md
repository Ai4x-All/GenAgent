- `RegionalPromptColorMask __Inspire`: The RegionalPromptColorMask node is designed to generate regional prompts based on a color mask. It applies a color-based segmentation to an image, creating distinct regions that can be individually prompted for creative or targeted image generation tasks. This node facilitates the customization of image generation processes by allowing users to influence specific areas of an image through color-coded masks.
    - Parameters:
        - `mask_color`: A string specifying the color used in the color_mask to define the regions of interest. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `cfg`: A floating-point value that adjusts the configuration strength, influencing the intensity of the applied prompts. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Specifies the sampling method to be used in the generation process, affecting the diversity and quality of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Determines the scheduling algorithm for controlling the generation process, impacting how prompts are applied over time. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `wildcard_prompt`: A string input for dynamic, user-defined prompts that can be applied to the specified regions, enhancing creative control. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `controlnet_in_pipe`: A boolean indicating whether to keep or override the control network within the pipeline, affecting the final image generation. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `sigma_factor`: A floating-point value that adjusts the sigma factor, fine-tuning the application of prompts to the regions. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `basic_pipe`: The foundational pipeline for image processing or generation, setting the stage for subsequent regional prompt application. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
        - `color_mask`: An image input that serves as a mask, where specific colors indicate regions for applying distinct prompts. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `regional_prompts`: The generated regional prompts, tailored to the specified areas of the input image. Type should be `REGIONAL_PROMPTS`.
        - `mask`: The mask generated from the specified color, used to delineate regions for prompt application. Type should be `MASK`.
