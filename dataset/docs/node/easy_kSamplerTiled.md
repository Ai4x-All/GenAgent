- `easy kSamplerTiled`: The `easy kSamplerTiled` node is designed to facilitate the sampling process in a tiled manner, leveraging various samplers and schedulers to generate or modify images based on provided conditions. It abstracts the complexity of selecting and configuring samplers and schedulers, making it easier for users to apply advanced sampling techniques to their image generation tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `tile_size`: Specifies the size of the tiles used in the sampling process, affecting the granularity of the generated image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `image_output`: Determines the output format of the image, influencing how the generated image is saved or displayed. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `link_id`: Provides a unique identifier for the link associated with the image output, used for tracking and referencing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `save_prefix`: Sets the prefix for saving the generated images, allowing for organized storage and retrieval. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Represents the pipeline configuration for the sampling process, including model and sampling settings. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model`: Selects the specific model to be used for the sampling process, influencing the style and characteristics of the generated image. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: Returns the updated pipeline configuration after the sampling process, encapsulating the sequence of operations and modifications. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `image`: Outputs the generated or modified image as a result of the sampling process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
