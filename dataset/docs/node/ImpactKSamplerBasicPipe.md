- `ImpactKSamplerBasicPipe`: The ImpactKSamplerBasicPipe node is designed for sampling operations within a basic pipeline, utilizing a variety of samplers and schedulers to process and transform latent images. It encapsulates the complexity of sampling algorithms, providing a streamlined interface for generating or modifying latent representations based on specified configurations and inputs.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: Determines the randomness seed for sampling, affecting the reproducibility and variation of the output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Specifies the number of steps to perform in the sampling process, impacting the detail and quality of the generated latent image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Controls the configuration for the sampling algorithm, influencing the behavior and outcomes of the sampling process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Selects the specific sampler to use, allowing for customization of the sampling technique. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Chooses the scheduler for controlling the sampling process, affecting the progression and adaptation of sampling steps. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: Adjusts the level of denoising applied to the latent image, fine-tuning the clarity and quality of the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `basic_pipe`: Represents the core components required for the sampling process, including models and configurations essential for the operation. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
        - `latent_image`: The initial latent image to be processed or transformed by the sampling operation. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `basic_pipe`: Returns the basic pipeline components, including the model and configurations used in the sampling process. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
        - `latent`: The processed or transformed latent image resulting from the sampling operation. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `vae`: The variational autoencoder used in the process, essential for encoding and decoding latent images. Type should be `VAE`.
