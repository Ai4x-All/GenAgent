- `XY Inputï€º Control Net Plot`: This node is designed to generate a series of values for plotting based on the control network's parameters over a specified range. It dynamically adjusts the input parameters such as strength, start percent, and end percent to create a dataset suitable for XY plotting, facilitating the visualization of how changes in these parameters affect the control network's output.
    - Parameters:
        - `plot_type`: Specifies the type of plot to generate, indicating how X and Y values are derived and related to each other. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `strength`: The strength parameter applied to the control net, affecting the output values for the plot. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_percent`: The starting percentage value, indicating the initial point of the range for the plot's X or Y axis. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_percent`: The ending percentage value, indicating the final point of the range for the plot's X or Y axis. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `X_batch_count`: Specifies the number of data points to generate for the X axis of the plot, affecting its granularity. Type should be `INT`.
        - `X_first_value`: The starting value for the X axis of the plot, marking the beginning of the range to be visualized. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `X_last_value`: The ending value for the X axis of the plot, marking the end of the range to be visualized. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `Y_batch_count`: Specifies the number of data points to generate for the Y axis of the plot, affecting its granularity. Type should be `INT`.
        - `Y_first_value`: The starting value for the Y axis of the plot, marking the beginning of the range to be visualized. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `Y_last_value`: The ending value for the Y axis of the plot, marking the end of the range to be visualized. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `control_net`: Represents the control network whose parameters are being adjusted for plotting. It is central to determining the output values for the XY plot. Type should be `CONTROL_NET`.
        - `image`: The image input that, along with the control net, influences the generated values for the XY plot. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `cnet_stack`: An optional stack of additional parameters that can be appended to each data point, allowing for more complex or detailed plots. Type should be `CONTROL_NET_STACK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `X`: Represents the X values generated for the plot, based on the specified input parameters and adjustments. Type should be `XY`.
        - `Y`: Represents the Y values generated for the plot, based on the specified input parameters and adjustments. Type should be `XY`.
