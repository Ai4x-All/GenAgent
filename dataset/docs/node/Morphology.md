- `Morphology`: The Morphology node provides a suite of image morphology operations, such as erosion, dilation, opening, closing, gradient, top hat, and bottom hat transformations. These operations are fundamental for image processing and analysis, allowing for the modification of the geometrical structure of images.
    - Parameters:
        - `operation`: Specifies the morphological operation to be applied to the image. Options include 'erode', 'dilate', 'open', 'close', 'gradient', 'bottom_hat', and 'top_hat', each affecting the image's structure in unique ways. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `kernel_size`: Determines the size of the kernel used for the morphological operation. A larger kernel size will have a more pronounced effect on the image's structure. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be processed. The choice of operation and kernel size will determine how the image's structure is modified. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output image after applying the specified morphological operation. This image will have undergone structural modifications based on the operation and kernel size chosen. Type should be `IMAGE`.
