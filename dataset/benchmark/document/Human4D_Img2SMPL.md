- `Human4D_Img2SMPL`: The Human4D_Img2SMPL node is designed to transform 2D human images into 3D representations using the SMPL model. It leverages deep learning models to detect human figures in images, estimate their poses, and generate corresponding 3D mesh models, enabling advanced motion analysis and visualization.
    - Inputs:
        - `human4d_model` (Required): The human4D model encapsulates the necessary configurations and models for detecting humans in images and generating their 3D SMPL representations. It plays a crucial role in the node's ability to accurately process and transform 2D images into 3D models. Type should be `HUMAN4D_MODEL`.
        - `image` (Required): The input image tensor containing human figures to be transformed into 3D SMPL models. This tensor is critical for the node to perform human detection and pose estimation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `det_confidence_thresh` (Required): The confidence threshold for human detection. This parameter helps in filtering out detections with low confidence, ensuring that only high-confidence human figures are processed for 3D modeling. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `det_iou_thresh` (Required): The Intersection Over Union (IOU) threshold for human detection. It is used to manage the overlap between detected bounding boxes, improving the precision of human detection. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `det_batch_size` (Required): The batch size for processing detections. This parameter affects the throughput and efficiency of the human detection process, balancing between speed and memory usage. Type should be `INT`.
        - `hmr_batch_size` (Required): The batch size for the HMR (Human Mesh Recovery) process. It determines how many human figures are processed simultaneously for 3D modeling, impacting the node's performance and resource utilization. Type should be `INT`.
        - `opt_scorehmr_refiner` (Optional): An optional parameter for refining the scores from the HMR process. If provided, it enhances the accuracy of the 3D SMPL models generated by the node. Type should be `SCORE_HMR_MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `smpl_multiple_subjects`: The output is a comprehensive 3D representation of multiple human subjects derived from 2D images, including mesh models, pose information, and additional metadata for advanced motion analysis. Type should be `SMPL_MULTIPLE_SUBJECTS`.
