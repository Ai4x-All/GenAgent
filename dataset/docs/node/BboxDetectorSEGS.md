- `BboxDetectorSEGS`: The BboxDetectorSEGS node is designed to detect bounding boxes around objects within images, leveraging segmentation techniques to enhance the accuracy and detail of the detection process. It combines the capabilities of bounding box detection with segmentation to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the objects' shapes and boundaries.
    - Parameters:
        - `threshold`: A threshold value for bounding box detection, determining the sensitivity of the detector to potential objects within the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `dilation`: Specifies the dilation applied to the detected bounding boxes, allowing for adjustments in the size of the bounding area around detected objects. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_factor`: Determines the extent to which the area around the detected object is included in the crop, affecting the context provided around the detected object. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `drop_size`: Sets the minimum size for detected objects, filtering out objects smaller than this size to focus on more significant detections. Type should be `INT`.
        - `labels`: Optional labels to filter the detected objects, allowing for selective segmentation based on specified categories. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `bbox_detector`: Specifies the bounding box detector model to be used for detecting objects within the image. It plays a crucial role in the initial detection phase before segmentation is applied. Type should be `BBOX_DETECTOR`.
        - `image`: The input images or frames on which object detection and segmentation are to be performed. This is the primary data that the node operates on. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `detailer_hook`: An optional hook for detailed processing or modifications of the detection and segmentation process, providing a way to customize the output. Type should be `DETAILER_HOOK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `segs`: The output of the node includes segmentation information derived from the detected bounding boxes, providing detailed insights into the objects' shapes and boundaries. Type should be `SEGS`.
