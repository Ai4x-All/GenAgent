- `NoiseInjectionDetailerHookProvider`: This node is designed to inject noise into the detailer process, allowing for enhanced control over the noise characteristics throughout the cycle. It leverages schedules and strength parameters to dynamically adjust the noise injection based on the cycle's progress.
    - Parameters:
        - `schedule_for_cycle`: Specifies the schedule to be used for the noise injection cycle, influencing how noise characteristics are adjusted over time. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `source`: unknown Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed`: A seed value for noise generation, ensuring reproducibility of the noise characteristics. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_strength`: The initial strength of the noise to be injected at the beginning of the cycle. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_strength`: The final strength of the noise to be injected by the end of the cycle, allowing for dynamic adjustment. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `detailer_hook`: Produces a detailer hook configured for noise injection, ready to be integrated into the detailer process. Type should be `DETAILER_HOOK`.
