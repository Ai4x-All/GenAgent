- `easy preSampling`: The 'easy preSampling' node is designed to facilitate the pre-sampling process in generative models, providing a simplified interface for configuring and executing pre-sampling operations. It abstracts the complexities involved in pre-sampling settings, allowing users to easily adjust parameters such as sampling steps, configuration gradients, and noise levels to influence the generation process.
    - Parameters:
        - `steps`: Specifies the number of steps to be used in the pre-sampling process, affecting the detail and quality of the generated output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Controls the configuration gradient, influencing the strength of the conditioning on the generated output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Determines the sampling algorithm to be used, impacting the generation's diversity and quality. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Selects the scheduling algorithm for the sampling process, affecting the progression of noise reduction. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: Adjusts the denoising level applied during sampling, fine-tuning the clarity of the generated output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `seed`: Sets the random seed for the sampling process, ensuring reproducibility of the results. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: The 'pipe' parameter represents the pipeline configuration, including model, sampler, and other settings, serving as the foundation for the pre-sampling process. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `image_to_latent`: Optional parameter to provide an image for conversion to latent space, enabling direct manipulation of latent representations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `latent`: Optional parameter to directly provide a latent representation for sampling, offering advanced control over the generation process. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: Returns the updated pipeline configuration, including the results of the pre-sampling process and any modifications to the settings. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
