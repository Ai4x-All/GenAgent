- `JWImageResizeByLongerSide`: This node resizes an image by adjusting its longer side to a specified size, maintaining the aspect ratio, and allows for different interpolation methods to be applied during the resizing process.
    - Inputs:
        - `image` (Required): The image to be resized. It's crucial for maintaining the visual content while adjusting the dimensions. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `size` (Required): The target size for the longer side of the image, which determines the new dimensions while preserving the aspect ratio. Type should be `INT`.
        - `interpolation_mode` (Required): Specifies the method used for interpolating the pixels in the resized image, affecting the visual quality of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resized image with its longer side adjusted to the specified size, maintaining the original aspect ratio. Type should be `IMAGE`.
