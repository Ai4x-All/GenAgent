- `IPAdapter`: The IPAdapter node serves as a modular component designed to adapt and apply various image processing techniques to models within the ComfyUI framework. It enables the customization and enhancement of image generation processes through a diverse set of parameters and methods, facilitating a wide range of artistic and technical manipulations.
    - Inputs:
        - `model` (Required): The model parameter represents the neural network model to which the IPAdapter will apply its image processing techniques, serving as the foundation for the adaptations and enhancements performed by the node. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `ipadapter` (Required): This parameter specifies the particular IPAdapter configuration or method to be applied, dictating the specific image processing techniques and customizations that will be executed on the model. Type should be `IPADAPTER`.
        - `image` (Required): The image parameter is the input image to be processed or manipulated by the IPAdapter, serving as the primary subject for the node's image processing techniques. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `weight` (Required): Specifies the weight of the adaptation effect, allowing for fine-tuning of the intensity of the applied image processing techniques. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_at` (Required): Defines the starting point of the effect application in a process, enabling phased or gradual application of image processing techniques. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_at` (Required): Determines the endpoint of the effect application, allowing for precise control over how the image processing techniques conclude. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weight_type` (Required): Indicates the type of weighting method to be used, affecting how the adaptation effect is applied over the process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `attn_mask` (Optional): An optional parameter that provides an attention mask to focus or exclude specific areas from the image processing effects. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The modified model after applying the specified IPAdapter techniques and parameters, showcasing the adaptations and enhancements. Type should be `MODEL`.
