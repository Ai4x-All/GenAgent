- `CtrlNet MiDaS Settings (JPS)`: This node is designed to configure settings for the MiDaS depth estimation model within a control network, allowing users to specify the source of depth information, its strength, and the range over which the depth effect should be applied.
    - Inputs:
        - `midas_from` (Required): Specifies the source of depth information, offering options such as 'Source Image', 'Support Image', or 'Support Direct'. This choice determines the origin of depth data for processing. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `midas_strength` (Required): Controls the intensity of the depth effect applied by the MiDaS model, with a range allowing for fine-tuned adjustments to the depth perception. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `midas_start` (Required): Defines the starting point of the depth effect's application, enabling precise control over where the depth begins to take effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `midas_end` (Required): Sets the endpoint for the depth effect, allowing users to limit the depth's influence to a specific range within the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `midas_a` (Required): Adjusts a specific parameter within the MiDaS model, offering additional customization of the depth effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `midas_bg` (Required): Modifies the background depth value, enabling users to fine-tune the depth effect's background intensity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `midas_settings`: Outputs the configured settings for the MiDaS model as a tuple, ready for use in depth estimation processes. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
