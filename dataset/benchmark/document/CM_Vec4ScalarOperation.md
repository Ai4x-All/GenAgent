- `CM_Vec4ScalarOperation`: Performs scalar operations on 4-dimensional vectors, allowing for the manipulation of vector components with a scalar value. This node abstracts mathematical operations such as multiplication or division, facilitating vector transformations in a 4D space.
    - Inputs:
        - `op` (Required): Specifies the scalar operation to be performed on the vector, such as multiplication or division, influencing the resulting vector transformation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `a` (Required): The 4-dimensional vector to be transformed, serving as the primary operand in the scalar operation. Type should be `VEC4`.
        - `b` (Required): The scalar value to be applied to the vector, acting as the secondary operand in the operation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `vec4`: The transformed 4-dimensional vector resulting from the specified scalar operation. Type should be `VEC4`.
