- `Intrinsic_lora_sampling`: This node integrates intrinsic LoRAs (Low-Rank Adaptations) into a given model to perform specialized sampling tasks, such as generating depth maps, surface normals, albedo, and shading. It leverages intrinsic LoRAs to modify the model's behavior for specific visual tasks, enabling the generation of images with detailed attributes based on the selected task.
    - Parameters:
        - `lora_name`: The name of the intrinsic LoRa to be loaded and applied to the model, chosen from a predefined list of available LoRAs. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `task`: Specifies the visual task for which the image is generated, such as depth map, surface normals, albedo, or shading, influencing the modification applied to the model. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `text`: Text input that, combined with the task, guides the image generation process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `per_batch`: The number of samples processed per batch, affecting the efficiency and speed of the image generation process. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model to which intrinsic LoRAs will be applied, modifying its behavior for specific visual tasks. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: A CLIP model used for text encoding, aiding in the generation process by providing text-based guidance. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `vae`: A VAE model used for decoding the sampled latent representations into images. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `image`: An optional image input for tasks that require an initial image, providing a starting point for the generation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `optional_latent`: An optional latent representation that can be used as a starting point for the generation process, bypassing the need for an initial image. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The generated image with attributes specified by the task, such as depth map or surface normals. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `latent`: The latent representation of the generated image, providing insight into the model's internal representation. Type should be `LATENT`.
