- `VHS_LoadImages`: The node 'VHS_LoadImages' is designed to facilitate the loading of images from a specified directory, supporting operations such as image capping, skipping initial images, and selecting every nth image to efficiently manage and process image batches for video or image-based projects.
    - Parameters:
        - `directory`: Specifies the directory from which images are to be loaded, serving as the primary source for the image loading operation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `image_load_cap`: Limits the number of images to be loaded from the directory, allowing for control over the batch size for processing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `skip_first_images`: Skips a specified number of initial images in the directory, useful for starting the loading process from a certain point. Type should be `INT`.
        - `select_every_nth`: Loads every nth image from the directory, enabling selective processing of images at regular intervals. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The loaded images, processed and ready for further use in the workflow. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: The masks associated with the loaded images, if available, for use in image processing tasks. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `int`: The total count of images loaded from the directory, providing insight into the batch size. Type should be `INT`.
