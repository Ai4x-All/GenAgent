- `DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode`: This node is designed to integrate translation services with CLIP text encoding, facilitating the translation of text inputs into different languages and subsequently encoding these translations into a format suitable for conditioning models. It serves as a foundational component for nodes that require both translation and text encoding capabilities, streamlining the process of preparing text for various AI-driven applications.
    - Parameters:
        - `from_translate`: Specifies the source language for translation, supporting a dynamic range of languages based on the selected translation service. It plays a crucial role in determining the initial language of the text to be translated. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `to_translate`: Defines the target language for the translation, allowing for the conversion of text into a wide variety of languages as supported by the chosen translation service. This parameter is essential for specifying the desired output language of the translation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `add_proxies`: Indicates whether proxy usage is enabled or disabled for the translation service, affecting how the translation requests are sent. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `proxies`: Provides the proxy settings to be used if proxy usage is enabled, facilitating the translation requests through specified proxy servers. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `auth_data`: Contains authorization data required by some translation services, ensuring secure access to the translation features. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `service`: Specifies the translation service to be used, allowing for the selection among various supported translation providers. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `text`: The text input to be translated and encoded. This parameter is central to the node's functionality, serving as the content that undergoes translation and subsequent text encoding. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip`: A CLIP model instance used for encoding the translated text into a format that is compatible with conditioning models. This parameter is key for integrating the translation output with downstream AI processes. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: The encoded representation of the translated text, formatted for use in conditioning models. This output is crucial for applications requiring text input to be in a specific encoded format. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `string`: The translated text, providing the direct output of the translation process. This output is essential for understanding or further processing the translated content. Type should be `STRING`.
