- `M2M VFI`: The M2M VFI node specializes in video frame interpolation, leveraging deep learning models to predict and generate intermediate frames between existing frames in a video sequence. This process enhances video fluidity and can be used to increase the frame rate of videos.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: The checkpoint name for the model, determining which pretrained model weights to load for frame interpolation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clear_cache_after_n_frames`: Specifies after how many frames the cache should be cleared to prevent memory overflow, affecting performance and resource management. Type should be `INT`.
        - `multiplier`: A factor that determines how many intermediate frames are to be generated between each pair of input frames, directly influencing the output video's frame rate. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `frames`: The input video frames to be interpolated. These frames provide the visual context for generating intermediate frames. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `optional_interpolation_states`: Optional states that can influence frame skipping and interpolation behavior, allowing for more control over the interpolation process. Type should be `INTERPOLATION_STATES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output interpolated frames, enhancing the video's smoothness and frame rate. Type should be `IMAGE`.
