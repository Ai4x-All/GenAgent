- `easy kSamplerInpainting`: The 'easy kSamplerInpainting' node specializes in generating inpainted images by seamlessly integrating specified patches or modifications into existing images. It leverages advanced sampling techniques to ensure the inpainted areas blend naturally with the untouched parts of the image, making it ideal for tasks such as object removal, restoration, or creative alterations.
    - Parameters:
        - `grow_mask_by`: Specifies the number of pixels by which to expand the inpainting mask, allowing for smoother transitions and better integration of the inpainted area with the surrounding image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `image_output`: Determines the output behavior of the inpainted image, offering options such as previewing, saving, or sending the result. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `link_id`: A unique identifier for linking the inpainting task with other processes or outputs, facilitating workflow integration. Type should be `INT`.
        - `save_prefix`: Defines a prefix for the saved image file names, helping organize and identify inpainted images easily. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `additional`: Allows for the selection of additional processing options like differential diffusion or specific model conditioning, further customizing the inpainting results. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Represents the pipeline configuration for image processing, including model and image data. It's crucial for defining the flow and parameters of the inpainting task. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model`: The model used for inpainting, essential for processing the image and applying the inpainting algorithm. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `mask`: The mask that defines the area to be inpainted, crucial for targeting specific parts of the image for modification. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `patch`: An optional patch to be applied during inpainting, allowing for specific modifications or corrections in the image. Type should be `INPAINT_PATCH`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The updated pipeline configuration after inpainting, including any changes to the model or image data. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `image`: The resulting inpainted image, showcasing the seamless integration of modifications with the original image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `vae`: The variational autoencoder used in the inpainting process, potentially updated during the operation. Type should be `VAE`.
