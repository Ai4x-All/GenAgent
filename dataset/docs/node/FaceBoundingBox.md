- `FaceBoundingBox`: The FaceBoundingBox node is designed to detect and extract the bounding boxes of faces within an image. It utilizes analysis models to identify faces and calculate their bounding box coordinates, optionally adjusting for padding to ensure the entire face is captured.
    - Parameters:
        - `padding`: An optional padding value to expand the bounding boxes, ensuring the entire face is captured without being too close to the edges. Type should be `INT`.
        - `index`: Optionally specifies the index of a specific face to focus on, with a default value that processes all detected faces. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `analysis_models`: Specifies the models and libraries used for face detection, impacting the accuracy and method of bounding box calculation. Type should be `ANALYSIS_MODELS`.
        - `image`: The input image in which faces are to be detected and their bounding boxes calculated. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `IMAGE`: The cropped image of the detected face, adjusted according to the specified padding and index. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `x`: The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the face bounding box. Type should be `INT`.
        - `y`: The y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the face bounding box. Type should be `INT`.
        - `width`: The width of the face bounding box. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The height of the face bounding box. Type should be `INT`.
