- `RegionalPromptSimple __Inspire`: The RegionalPromptSimple node is designed to generate regional prompts based on a given basic pipeline configuration and a mask. It utilizes the basic components of a generative model pipeline, including model, clip, and VAE settings, along with positive and negative prompts, to create new prompts that are regionally focused. This node is essential for tasks that require targeted prompt generation within specific areas of an image, enabling more precise control over the generative process.
    - Parameters:
        - `cfg`: The configuration setting for the generative model, influencing the detail and quality of the generated prompts. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Specifies the sampling method to be used in the generative process, affecting the diversity and quality of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Determines the scheduling algorithm for the generative model, impacting the progression and variation of the generated prompts. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `wildcard_prompt`: An optional prompt that can be dynamically inserted into the generation process, offering flexibility and creativity in prompt design. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `controlnet_in_pipe`: A boolean flag indicating whether to keep or override existing control settings in the pipeline, affecting the influence of control mechanisms on the generation process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `sigma_factor`: A scaling factor for the noise level in the sampling process, allowing for fine-tuning of the prompt generation's randomness and variability. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `basic_pipe`: Represents the foundational components of the generative model pipeline, including the model, clip, VAE, and positive and negative prompts. It is crucial for defining the base upon which regional prompts are generated. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
        - `mask`: A binary mask that specifies the region of interest within an image. It plays a pivotal role in determining where the regional prompts will be applied, allowing for targeted prompt generation. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `regional_prompts`: The generated regional prompts, tailored to the specified region of interest within the image, enabling targeted and precise control over the content generation. Type should be `REGIONAL_PROMPTS`.
