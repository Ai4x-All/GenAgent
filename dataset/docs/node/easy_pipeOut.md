- `easy pipeOut`: The `pipeOut` node is designed to process and output a modified pipeline configuration, focusing on integrating various components such as models, clips, and VAEs into a cohesive pipeline structure. It aims to facilitate the easy manipulation and output of pipeline configurations for further processing or use within a larger system.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: The `pipe` parameter represents the pipeline configuration to be processed. It is essential for determining the structure and components of the pipeline that will be outputted. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The modified pipeline configuration after processing. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model`: The model component of the pipeline. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `pos`: The positive conditioning component of the pipeline. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `neg`: The negative conditioning component of the pipeline. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent`: The latent representation component of the pipeline. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `vae`: The VAE component of the pipeline. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `clip`: The CLIP component of the pipeline. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `image`: The image component of the pipeline. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `seed`: The seed used for random number generation in the pipeline. Type should be `INT`.
