- `ImpactIPAdapterApplySEGS`: This node applies an IP Adapter to SEGS (segmentation elements), enhancing or modifying them based on a set of parameters and a reference image. It is designed to work within the context of image processing, particularly in adjusting and refining segmentation results through advanced control mechanisms.
    - Parameters:
        - `weight`: A weight factor influencing the adaptation strength. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `noise`: Noise level to be applied during the adaptation process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weight_type`: Specifies the type of weight application in the adaptation process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_at`: Defines the starting point within the segmentation elements for the adaptation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_at`: Defines the ending point within the segmentation elements for the adaptation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `unfold_batch`: Determines whether the adaptation process should unfold across batches. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `faceid_v2`: Indicates whether to use an updated version of face identification in the adaptation process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `weight_v2`: A secondary weight factor for the adaptation, potentially for an updated adaptation mechanism. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `context_crop_factor`: A factor determining the extent of the context crop around the segmentation elements. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `combine_embeds`: Method for combining embeddings in the adaptation process, defaulting to 'concat'. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `segs`: The segmentation elements to be processed, providing the basis for the adaptation process. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `ipadapter_pipe`: A pipeline of IP Adapter configurations, dictating how the segmentation elements are to be modified. Type should be `IPADAPTER_PIPE`.
        - `reference_image`: The reference image against which the segmentation elements are adapted. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `neg_image`: An optional negative image to be considered during the adaptation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `segs`: The adapted segmentation elements, reflecting the applied modifications. Type should be `SEGS`.
