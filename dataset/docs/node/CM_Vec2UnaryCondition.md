- `CM_Vec2UnaryCondition`: This node performs unary condition operations on 2-dimensional vectors, evaluating a specified condition for a given vector.
    - Parameters:
        - `op`: Specifies the unary condition operation to be performed on the vector. The choice of operation affects the outcome of the condition evaluation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `a`: The 2-dimensional vector on which the unary condition operation is to be performed. Type should be `VEC2`.
    - Outputs:
        - `bool`: The result of the unary condition operation, indicating whether the specified condition holds true for the given vector. Type should be `BOOL`.
