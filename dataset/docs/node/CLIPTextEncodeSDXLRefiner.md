- `CLIPTextEncodeSDXLRefiner`: The CLIPTextEncodeSDXLRefiner node specializes in refining text inputs for image generation by encoding them using a CLIP model, incorporating aesthetic scores and dimensions to enhance the conditioning for image synthesis.
    - Parameters:
        - `ascore`: The aesthetic score parameter influences the aesthetic quality of the generated image, allowing for fine-tuning based on aesthetic preferences. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `width`: Specifies the desired width of the output image, impacting the aspect ratio and detail level of the generated image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Determines the height of the output image, affecting its aspect ratio and the level of detail in the vertical dimension. Type should be `INT`.
        - `text`: The text input to be encoded, serving as the primary source of semantic information for image generation. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip`: A CLIP model instance used for encoding the text input, crucial for interpreting the semantic content. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: Provides the encoded text along with aesthetic scores and dimensions, ready for use in further image synthesis processes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
