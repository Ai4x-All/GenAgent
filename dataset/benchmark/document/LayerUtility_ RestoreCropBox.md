- `LayerUtility_ RestoreCropBox`: The RestoreCropBox node is designed to reintegrate a previously cropped image back into its original background, optionally utilizing an inversion mask and a specific crop box to accurately place the cropped image. This functionality is crucial for image editing tasks where maintaining the original context of the image is necessary after modifications.

        - `invert_mask` (Required): A boolean flag indicating whether the mask used for cropping should be inverted during the restoration process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `crop_box` (Required): Defines the specific area (box) on the background image where the cropped image will be placed. Type should be `BOX`.
        - `croped_mask` (Optional): An optional mask that was used during the cropping process. It can be utilized for more precise restoration. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting image after the cropped image has been restored onto the original background. Type should be `IMAGE`.
