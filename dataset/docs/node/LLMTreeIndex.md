- `LLMTreeIndex`: The LLMTreeIndex node is designed to construct an index structure from a set of language model nodes, facilitating efficient querying and retrieval of information. It supports customization of the indexing process through parameters that control the depth and breadth of the tree, as well as the option to include additional context for more nuanced indexing.
    - Parameters:
        - `num_children`: Determines the maximum number of child nodes each node in the tree can have, influencing the tree's breadth. Type should be `INT`.
        - `build_tree`: Flag to control whether the tree structure should be constructed, allowing for flexibility in how the index is generated. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `llm_model`: Specifies the language model to be used for indexing, serving as the foundation for constructing the tree index. Type should be `LLM_MODEL`.
        - `llm_nodes`: Defines the set of nodes to be indexed, representing the data structure that the tree index will organize and make searchable. Type should be `LLM_NODES`.
        - `service_context`: Optional context provided to tailor the indexing process to specific service requirements, enhancing the relevance of the index. Type should be `LLM_CONTEXT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `llm_index`: The resulting index structure, optimized for efficient querying and retrieval within the specified language model context. Type should be `LLM_INDEX`.
