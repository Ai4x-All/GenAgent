- `LoadImagesFromDirectory`: This node is designed to load images from a specified directory, handling various image formats and optionally applying transformations such as EXIF orientation correction and conversion to a consistent color space. It supports loading a capped number of images, and can also generate masks for images with transparency, making it suitable for tasks that require both image and mask inputs.
    - Parameters:
        - `directory`: The path to the directory from which images are to be loaded. This parameter is crucial as it determines the source of the images for processing. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `image_load_cap`: Limits the number of images to load from the directory, enabling control over the volume of data processed. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_index`: Specifies the index of the first image to load from the sorted list of files in the directory, allowing for selective loading of images. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: A batch of loaded images, preprocessed and converted into tensors. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: A batch of masks corresponding to the loaded images, useful for segmentation tasks. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `int`: The total number of images successfully loaded from the directory. Type should be `INT`.
