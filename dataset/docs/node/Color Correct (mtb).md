- `Color Correct (mtb)`: Provides a suite of color correction functionalities for images, including adjustments for gamma, contrast, exposure, hue, saturation, and value. It aims to enhance or modify the visual appearance of images according to specified parameters.
    - Parameters:
        - `clamp`: A boolean parameter that determines whether the color values should be clamped. Clamping ensures that the color values do not exceed the allowable range. Type should be `COMBO[BOOLEAN]`.
        - `gamma`: Adjusts the gamma value of the image, affecting the luminance of the image. A higher gamma value brightens the image, while a lower value darkens it. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `contrast`: Modifies the contrast of the image. Higher values increase contrast, making darks darker and lights lighter. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `exposure`: Adjusts the exposure level of the image, simulating the effect of changing the amount of light captured in a photograph. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `offset`: Applies an offset to the color values of the image, shifting all colors by a fixed amount. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `hue`: Alters the hue of the image, changing the overall color tone without affecting brightness or saturation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `saturation`: Adjusts the saturation of the image, affecting the intensity of the colors. Higher values make colors more vivid, while lower values result in a more muted color palette. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `value`: Modifies the value (brightness) of the image, allowing for adjustments in how light or dark the image appears. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be color corrected. This is the primary data upon which all color correction operations are performed. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The color-corrected image, after applying the specified adjustments. Type should be `IMAGE`.
