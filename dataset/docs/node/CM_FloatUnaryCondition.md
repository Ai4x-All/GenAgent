- `CM_FloatUnaryCondition`: This node performs unary operations on floating-point numbers based on a specified condition. It evaluates a single float input against a predefined condition, such as checking if the number is zero, positive, negative, or NaN, among others.
    - Parameters:
        - `op`: Specifies the unary operation to be performed on the float input. The operation is chosen from a predefined list of conditions like 'IsZero', 'IsPositive', etc., which determine the nature of the evaluation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `a`: The floating-point number to be evaluated against the specified unary condition. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `bool`: The result of the unary condition evaluation, indicating whether the condition holds true for the input float. Type should be `BOOL`.
