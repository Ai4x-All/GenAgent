- `VAEEncodeBatch`: The VAEEncodeBatch node is designed to encode a batch of images into their latent representations using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). It processes multiple images sequentially, leveraging a VAE model to transform each image into a latent space vector, and then concatenates these vectors to form a batch of latent representations.
    - Inputs:
        - `inputs_len` (Required): Specifies the number of images to encode into their latent representations. It determines the size of the batch that will be processed by the node. Type should be `INT`.
        - `vae` (Required): The Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model used for encoding images into their latent representations. It is a crucial component that defines the encoding mechanism. Type should be `VAE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The latent representation of the encoded images. It is a batch of vectors in the latent space, representing the input images. Type should be `LATENT`.
