- `CR Set Value On Binary`: The CR_SetValueOnBinary node is designed to conditionally assign a value based on a binary input. It facilitates decision-making processes within a workflow by allowing users to specify different outcomes (values) depending on whether the binary input is 1 or 0.
    - Parameters:
        - `binary`: The binary input determines the branch of execution: if the input is 1, one value is returned; if 0, another value is chosen. This binary decision-making forms the core functionality of the node. Type should be `INT`.
        - `value_if_1`: Specifies the value to return if the binary input is 1, enabling conditional logic based on binary input. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `value_if_0`: Specifies the value to return if the binary input is 0, enabling conditional logic based on binary input. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `INT`: The integer representation of the selected value based on the binary input. Type should be `INT`.
        - `FLOAT`: The floating-point representation of the selected value based on the binary input. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `show_help`: A URL to the help documentation for this node. Type should be `STRING`.
