- `Image Resize Factor (mtb)`: This node is designed to resize images based on a specified scaling factor, optionally applying supersampling for higher quality resizing. It supports different resampling strategies to accommodate various image processing needs.
    - Inputs:
        - `image` (Required): The input image tensor to be resized. This tensor's dimensions are checked to ensure they meet the expected format for processing. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `factor` (Required): The scaling factor to resize the image by. This determines the new dimensions of the output image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `supersample` (Required): A boolean flag indicating whether supersampling should be applied during resizing for enhanced image quality. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `resampling` (Required): The method of resampling to use when resizing the image. This affects the quality and characteristics of the output image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `mask` (Optional): An optional mask that can be applied during the resizing process. If provided, it is used in conjunction with the image data. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resized image tensor, potentially supersampled for enhanced quality, and resized according to the specified factor and resampling method. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: The mask tensor, if provided, resized to match the dimensions of the output image tensor. Type should be `MASK`.
