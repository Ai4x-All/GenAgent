- `ConditioningSetMask`: This node is designed to modify the conditioning of a generative model by applying a mask and optionally setting the conditioning area to the bounds of the mask. It allows for the dynamic adjustment of the conditioning's influence through a strength parameter, enabling fine-tuned control over the generative process.
    - Parameters:
        - `strength`: A scalar value that determines the intensity of the mask's effect on the conditioning. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `set_cond_area`: A flag to determine whether the conditioning area should be set to the mask bounds or not. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `conditioning`: The conditioning data to be modified, serving as the context for the generative model's output. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `mask`: A mask tensor used to specify the area of the conditioning to be modified. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: The modified conditioning data, with the mask applied and potentially adjusted according to the specified area and strength. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
