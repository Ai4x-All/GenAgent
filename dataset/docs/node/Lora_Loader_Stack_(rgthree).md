- `Lora Loader Stack (rgthree)`: The Lora Loader Stack (rgthree) node is designed to dynamically load multiple LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) modifications into a given model and clip, enhancing or altering their capabilities based on specified LoRA files and their associated strengths. It allows for the sequential application of up to four LoRA modifications, providing a flexible mechanism for model customization.
    - Parameters:
        - `lora_i`: Specifies a LoRA file to be applied to the model and clip. The choice of LoRA file directly influences the nature of the modification, allowing for targeted adjustments. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `strength_i`: Determines the intensity of the LoRA modification's impact on the model and clip, enabling fine-tuned control over the adaptation's effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model parameter represents the neural network model to which LoRA modifications will be applied. It is crucial for defining the base architecture that will be enhanced or altered by the LoRA layers. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The clip parameter signifies the CLIP model that will be adjusted using LoRA modifications. It plays a key role in specifying the target for LoRA enhancements alongside the primary model. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The modified neural network model, now enhanced with up to four LoRA modifications as specified. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The adjusted CLIP model, reflecting the cumulative effects of the applied LoRA modifications. Type should be `CLIP`.
