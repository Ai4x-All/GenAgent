- `SaltScheduledImageAdjust`: This node is designed to apply scheduled adjustments to a batch of images, allowing for dynamic changes in brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpness, gaussian blur, and edge enhancement over time. It enables the creation of sequences where image properties evolve according to predefined schedules, enhancing visual storytelling or data visualization.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The collection of images to be adjusted. This parameter is central to the node's operation, as it defines the set of images that will undergo the scheduled transformations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `masks`: Optional masks to apply the adjustments selectively on the images. This allows for more precise control over which areas of the images are affected by the adjustments. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `brightness_schedule`: A schedule defining how the brightness of the images should change over time. This enables dynamic visual effects by altering the lightness of the images according to a predefined sequence. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `contrast_schedule`: A schedule that dictates the contrast adjustments over time, allowing for the enhancement or reduction of the difference between the darkest and lightest parts of the images. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `saturation_schedule`: Defines how the color intensity of the images changes over time, enabling the creation of vibrant or muted color sequences. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `sharpness_schedule`: A schedule for adjusting the clarity or blur of the images' details over time, facilitating the focus on specific elements or the creation of dreamy sequences. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `gaussian_blur_schedule`: Determines the degree of Gaussian blur applied to the images over time, allowing for the creation of soft-focus effects or transitions. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `edge_enhance_schedule`: A schedule for enhancing the edges within the images over time, which can be used to highlight details or create a more graphic look. Type should be `LIST`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The adjusted images after the application of the scheduled adjustments, showcasing the dynamic changes over time. Type should be `IMAGE`.
