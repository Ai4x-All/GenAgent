- `Power Prompt (rgthree)`: The Power Prompt node is designed to process textual prompts, potentially enhancing them with additional context or modifications before further processing. It leverages utilities for handling specific text patterns and integrates with other components for text encoding, aiming to prepare the input for more sophisticated text-to-image or text-to-text applications.
    - Parameters:
        - `prompt`: The primary text input that the node processes. It may undergo various transformations or enhancements based on the node's logic and additional parameters provided. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `insert_lora`: Permits the inclusion of a LORA (Locally Optimized Receptive Attention) adjustment to the prompt, which can modify the processing behavior based on the selected LORA's attributes. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `insert_embedding`: Allows for the insertion of a pre-defined embedding into the prompt, enhancing its context or specificity for subsequent processing. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `insert_saved`: Enables the inclusion of a saved prompt from a predefined list, potentially adding more depth or context to the primary prompt. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `opt_model`: An optional parameter that allows for the selection of a specific model for processing the prompt, potentially influencing the outcome based on the model's characteristics. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `opt_clip`: An optional parameter that, if provided, allows for the encoding of the prompt alongside this parameter's value using a CLIP model. This can be used to generate a conditioning vector for further processing. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `CONDITIONING`: A conditioning vector generated from the prompt and optionally the 'opt_clip' parameter, using a CLIP model. This vector can be used for further processing in text-to-image or other generative tasks. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `MODEL`: The model selected for processing the prompt, if any, which can influence the final output. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `CLIP`: The CLIP model used for encoding the prompt, if specified, which can affect the conditioning vector generated. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `TEXT`: The processed or enhanced prompt, ready for further application or processing. Type should be `STRING`.
