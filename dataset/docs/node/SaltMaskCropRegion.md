- `SaltMaskCropRegion`: The SaltMaskCropRegion node focuses on cropping regions within masks based on specified criteria, such as dominant or minority areas, and applying padding around these regions. It aims to refine mask data by isolating and resizing specific regions, facilitating targeted analysis or manipulation of mask-based data.
    - Parameters:
        - `padding`: The 'padding' parameter specifies the amount of padding to add around the cropped region. It affects the size of the output cropped masks by expanding the cropped area, allowing for more flexible usage of the masks. Type should be `INT`.
        - `region_type`: The 'region_type' parameter determines the criteria for cropping, choosing between 'dominant' or 'minority' regions within the masks. This choice directs the cropping process, tailoring the output to specific areas of interest. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `masks`: The 'masks' parameter represents the input masks to be cropped. It is crucial for determining the areas within each mask that meet the specified cropping criteria, directly influencing the output cropped masks. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `cropped_masks`: The cropped masks after applying the specified cropping and padding, ready for further processing or analysis. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `crop_data_batch`: A batch of data detailing the cropping operations performed, including dimensions and locations of the cropped regions. Type should be `CROP_DATA_BATCH`.
        - `top_int`: The top boundary integer value of the cropped region. Type should be `INT`.
        - `left_int`: The left boundary integer value of the cropped region. Type should be `INT`.
        - `right_int`: The right boundary integer value of the cropped region. Type should be `INT`.
        - `bottom_int`: The bottom boundary integer value of the cropped region. Type should be `INT`.
        - `width_int`: The width integer value of the cropped region, calculated from the cropping data. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height_int`: The height integer value of the cropped region, calculated from the cropping data. Type should be `INT`.
