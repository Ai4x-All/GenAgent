- `Inference_Core_LineArtPreprocessor`: The Inference_Core_LineArtPreprocessor node is designed to preprocess images by extracting line art with a realistic style. It utilizes a specialized model to transform input images into line drawings, aiming to enhance or prepare the images for further processing or artistic applications.
    - Inputs:
        - `image` (Required): The input image to be processed for line art extraction. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `coarse` (Optional): Determines whether the line art extraction should be performed in a coarse manner. Enabling this option modifies the extraction process to potentially alter the level of detail in the resulting line art. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `resolution` (Optional): Specifies the resolution at which the line art extraction should be performed, affecting the detail and quality of the output. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is an image that has been processed to extract line art, reflecting a realistic style. Type should be `IMAGE`.
