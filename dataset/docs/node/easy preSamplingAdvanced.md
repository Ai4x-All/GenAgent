- `easy preSamplingAdvanced`: This node facilitates advanced pre-sampling operations within a generative pipeline, offering customizable settings for fine-tuning the sampling process. It allows for the adjustment of various parameters to optimize the generation of images or other media, catering to specific needs or experimental setups.
    - Parameters:
        - `steps`: Specifies the number of steps to be taken in the sampling process, affecting the granularity and quality of the output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Controls the conditioning factor, influencing the adherence of the generated output to the given conditions. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Selects the specific sampling algorithm to be used, allowing for customization of the sampling behavior. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Chooses the scheduling algorithm for the sampling process, affecting the progression of steps. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_at_step`: Defines the starting step for the sampling process, allowing for control over the phase of generation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_at_step`: Sets the ending step for the sampling process, determining the final phase of generation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `add_noise`: Enables or disables the addition of noise during the sampling process, affecting the texture and details of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed`: Sets the initial seed for the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of results. Type should be `INT`.
        - `return_with_leftover_noise`: Determines whether to return the output with leftover noise, impacting the visual characteristics of the generated media. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Represents the generative pipeline through which the data flows, serving as the foundation for the pre-sampling process. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `image_to_latent`: Optionally converts an image to a latent representation, integrating it into the pre-sampling process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `latent`: Optionally provides a latent representation to be used directly in the sampling process. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: Outputs the enhanced generative pipeline, enriched with the applied pre-sampling configurations. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
