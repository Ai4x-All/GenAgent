- `Sepconv VFI`: The Sepconv VFI node is designed for video frame interpolation, utilizing separable convolutional networks to enhance the smoothness and quality of interpolated frames. It leverages advanced deep learning techniques to predict intermediate frames between existing ones in a video sequence, aiming to achieve high fidelity and temporally coherent video frame interpolation.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: Specifies the checkpoint name for the model, which is crucial for loading the correct pretrained weights and ensuring the model operates as expected. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clear_cache_after_n_frames`: Determines after how many frames the cache should be cleared to manage memory usage effectively during interpolation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `multiplier`: Defines the number of intermediate frames to be generated between each pair of original frames, directly affecting the output video's frame rate. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `frames`: The input video frames to be interpolated. This parameter is essential for providing the raw data from which intermediate frames will be generated. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `optional_interpolation_states`: Allows for the passing of optional states that may affect the interpolation process, offering flexibility in handling different interpolation scenarios. Type should be `INTERPOLATION_STATES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output interpolated video frames, enhanced in smoothness and quality through the sepconv VFI process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
