- `CLIPTextEncodeList`: This node is designed for encoding textual inputs using a CLIP model, transforming them into a structured format that can be utilized for further computational tasks or analyses. It focuses on processing multiple text inputs, applying tokenization and encoding to extract relevant features for downstream applications.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip` (Required): The 'clip' parameter represents the CLIP model used for text encoding. It is crucial for the node's operation as it determines how text inputs are processed and encoded. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `token_normalization` (Required): Specifies the method for normalizing tokens, affecting the encoding process's outcome. It plays a significant role in adjusting the encoding based on the chosen normalization strategy. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `weight_interpretation` (Required): Defines how weights are interpreted during the encoding process, influencing the final encoded output. It's important for tailoring the encoding to specific weight interpretation preferences. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `text` (Required): The textual input to be encoded. This parameter is essential as it provides the raw data for the encoding process. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning_sequence`: The output is a sequence of conditionings derived from the encoded text inputs. It's significant for subsequent computational tasks that rely on these encoded representations. Type should be `CONDITIONING_SEQ`.
