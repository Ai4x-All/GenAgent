- `SeargeSDXLSampler`: The SeargeSDXLSampler node is designed to facilitate sampling operations within the SDXL framework, providing foundational support for generating or refining samples based on specific inputs. It serves as a core component in the process of creating or enhancing digital content, leveraging the capabilities of the SDXL architecture.
    - Parameters:
        - `noise_seed`: Optional input specifying the seed for noise generation, influencing the randomness of the sampling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Required input specifying the number of steps to perform in the sampling process, affecting the detail and quality of the output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Required input specifying the CFG (classifier-free guidance) scale, adjusting the influence of conditioning on the generation process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Required input specifying the name of the sampler to use, determining the algorithm for the sampling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Required input specifying the scheduler to use, affecting the progression of steps in the sampling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `base_ratio`: Required input specifying the ratio of influence between the base and refiner models on the final output, balancing their contributions. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `denoise`: Optional input specifying the denoise level, affecting the clarity and sharpness of the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `base_model`: Required input specifying the model to be used as the base for sampling, essential for the initial generation phase. Type should be `MODEL`.

        - `base_negative`: Required input specifying negative conditioning for the base model, steering the initial generation away from undesired attributes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `refiner_model`: Required input specifying the model to be used for refining the initial samples, enhancing their quality or altering their characteristics. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `refiner_positive`: Required input specifying positive conditioning for the refiner model, guiding the refinement process towards desired attributes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `refiner_negative`: Required input specifying negative conditioning for the refiner model, steering the refinement process away from undesired attributes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent_image`: Required input specifying the latent image to be used as a starting point for the sampling or refinement process. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - ``: unknown Type should be `LATENT`.
