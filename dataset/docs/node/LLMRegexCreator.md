        - `extra_directions`: Optional additional instructions or constraints to guide the language model in generating the regex pattern. These directions can refine the output by providing more context or specific requirements. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `llm_model`: Specifies the language model to use for generating the regex pattern. It is crucial for interpreting the description and extra directions to create the regex. Type should be `LLM_MODEL`.
