- `IPAdapterWeightsFromStrategy`: The IPAdapterWeightsFromStrategy node is designed to generate weights for image processing based on a specified strategy. It allows for the dynamic adjustment of image processing parameters, facilitating tailored image manipulation according to the strategy chosen.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `weights_strategy`: Specifies the strategy to be used for generating weights, influencing how images are processed and manipulated. Type should be `WEIGHTS_STRATEGY`.
        - `image`: An optional image input that can be used in conjunction with the weights strategy to further customize the image processing. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `weights`: The generated weights based on the specified strategy. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weights_invert`: The inverted weights derived from the original weights, used for alternative processing effects. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `total_frames`: The total number of frames calculated based on the weights strategy, affecting the duration of the image processing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `image_1`: The first image output, modified according to the weights and strategy applied. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_2`: The second image output, modified in a different manner based on the weights and strategy for varied effects. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `weights_strategy`: The weights strategy used for processing, including all parameters and settings involved. Type should be `WEIGHTS_STRATEGY`.
