- `SeedExplorer __Inspire`: The SeedExplorer __Inspire node is designed to facilitate exploration and manipulation of seed values within a generative workflow. It enables dynamic adjustment and application of seeds to influence the generation process, providing a means to explore variations and ensure consistency across generated outputs.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed_prompt`: A string input containing seed values and possibly other directives for generating variations. It's used to guide the generation process by specifying seed values and their intended effects. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `enable_additional`: A boolean flag that enables or disables the application of additional seed and strength parameters for further manipulation of the generation process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `additional_seed`: An integer representing an additional seed value to be applied alongside the main seed prompt for enhanced control over the generation outcomes. Type should be `INT`.
        - `additional_strength`: A floating-point value specifying the strength of the effect of the additional seed on the generation process. It allows for fine-tuning the impact of the additional seed. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `noise_mode`: Specifies whether the noise generation should occur on the GPU or CPU, affecting the performance and efficiency of the generation process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `initial_batch_seed_mode`: Determines the mode of seed application for the initial batch, influencing how seeds are applied and varied across multiple generations. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `latent`: Represents the initial latent space or image data that the node will manipulate using the provided seed values. It serves as the starting point for the seed exploration process. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `noise`: The manipulated noise tensor resulting from the application of seed values and additional parameters. It represents the direct output of the seed exploration process. Type should be `NOISE`.
