    - Inputs:
        - `seed` (Required): The seed parameter is crucial for initializing the random number generator to ensure reproducibility of results across different runs. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `seed`: Returns the same seed value that was input, allowing it to be used in subsequent operations. Type should be `INT`.
        - `show_help`: Provides a URL to the documentation for further assistance and detailed information about the CR Seed node. Type should be `STRING`.
