- `FakeScribblePreprocessor`: The FakeScribblePreprocessor node is designed for preprocessing images to simulate scribble lines, leveraging a modified HED (Holistically-Nested Edge Detection) model. This node aims to produce images with scribble-like lines, which can be useful in various image processing and computer vision tasks, especially in contexts where the stylization of edges as scribbles is desired.
    - Inputs:
        - `image` (Required): The input image to be processed for scribble line simulation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `safe` (Optional): A mode that, when enabled, applies a safety mechanism to the preprocessing, potentially altering the processing to avoid undesirable effects. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `resolution` (Optional): The resolution at which the image processing should be executed. This parameter allows for adjusting the detail level of the output image. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output image with simulated scribble lines, processed from the input image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
