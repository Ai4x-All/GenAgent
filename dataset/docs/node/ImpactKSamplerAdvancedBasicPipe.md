- `ImpactKSamplerAdvancedBasicPipe`: This node represents an advanced version of the KSampler within a pipeline, designed to facilitate complex sampling processes by integrating additional configurations and options for more nuanced control over the sampling outcome. It aims to enhance the flexibility and precision of sampling tasks in generative models.
    - Parameters:
        - `add_noise`: Indicates whether noise should be added to the sampling process, enabling or disabling this feature. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `noise_seed`: Specifies the seed for noise generation, ensuring reproducibility in the sampling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Defines the number of steps to be taken in the sampling process, affecting the depth of sampling. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Specifies the configuration setting for the sampling process, impacting the behavior and outcome of the sampler. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Determines the specific sampler algorithm to be used, allowing for customization of the sampling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Selects the scheduling algorithm to manage the sampling steps, influencing the progression and quality of the sampling. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_at_step`: Determines the starting step for the sampling process, allowing for mid-process initiation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_at_step`: Specifies the ending step for the sampling process, defining the termination point. Type should be `INT`.
        - `return_with_leftover_noise`: Controls whether the sampling process should return the result with leftover noise, affecting the final output. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `basic_pipe`: The basic pipeline configuration that the sampler operates on, including model and initial settings. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
        - `latent_image`: The initial latent image to be used in the sampling process, serving as the starting point. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `basic_pipe`: The basic pipeline configuration after the sampling process. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
        - `latent`: The resulting latent image after the sampling process. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `vae`: The VAE model used in the sampling process, included in the output for further use or analysis. Type should be `VAE`.
