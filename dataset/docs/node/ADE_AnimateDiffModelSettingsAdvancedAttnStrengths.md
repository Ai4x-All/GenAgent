- `ADE_AnimateDiffModelSettingsAdvancedAttnStrengths`: This node is designed to configure advanced attention strengths within the AnimateDiff model settings. It allows for fine-tuning of the model's attention mechanisms by adjusting the strengths of various attention components, providing a more detailed control over the animation generation process.
    - Parameters:
        - `pe_strength`: Specifies the strength of the positional encoding adjustments, influencing the model's spatial awareness. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attn_strength`: Defines the overall strength of the attention mechanism, affecting how the model focuses on different parts of the input. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attn_q_strength`: Adjusts the strength of the query component in the attention mechanism, fine-tuning the model's querying process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attn_k_strength`: Modifies the strength of the key component in the attention mechanism, impacting how the model matches queries to keys. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attn_v_strength`: Alters the strength of the value component in the attention mechanism, affecting the output based on the matched queries and keys. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attn_out_weight_strength`: Controls the strength of the attention output weights, influencing the final attention output's impact. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attn_out_bias_strength`: Adjusts the strength of the attention output bias, fine-tuning the bias applied to the attention output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `other_strength`: Specifies the strength of other model adjustments not directly related to attention, offering broader control over the model's behavior. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `motion_pe_stretch`: Defines the stretch factor for positional encoding in motion, affecting how motion is represented spatially. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cap_initial_pe_length`: Caps the initial length of positional encoding, limiting the spatial extent at the start of the animation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `interpolate_pe_to_length`: Determines the length to which positional encoding is interpolated, affecting the spatial resolution over time. Type should be `INT`.
        - `initial_pe_idx_offset`: Sets the initial offset for positional encoding indices, adjusting the starting spatial reference point. Type should be `INT`.
        - `final_pe_idx_offset`: Sets the final offset for positional encoding indices, adjusting the ending spatial reference point. Type should be `INT`.
        - `min_motion_scale`: Sets the minimum scale for motion, ensuring a lower bound on motion intensity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `max_motion_scale`: Sets the maximum scale for motion, ensuring an upper bound on motion intensity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `mask_motion_scale`: Optional tensor to scale motion selectively, allowing for differential motion scaling across the animation. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `ad_settings`: Returns the advanced attention strength settings for the AnimateDiff model, enabling precise control over the animation generation process. Type should be `AD_SETTINGS`.
