- `easy ipadapterApply`: The 'easy ipadapterApply' node is designed to seamlessly integrate and apply IPAdapter models to a given input model, enhancing its capabilities with additional features or adjustments specific to the IPAdapter's functionality. This process involves loading and caching IPAdapter models, potentially alongside other models like LoRA or InsightFace, depending on the configuration, to augment the original model's performance or features.
    - Parameters:
        - `preset`: A preset configuration that determines how the IPAdapter is applied, influencing the adaptation process and the resulting model enhancements. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lora_strength`: Specifies the strength of the LoRA model adjustments, if applicable, to the adaptation process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `provider`: The computing provider for the IPAdapter application, affecting performance and compatibility. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `weight`: A weight parameter influencing the adaptation process by the IPAdapter. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weight_faceidv2`: A specific weight parameter for FaceID v2 adjustments within the IPAdapter application. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_at`: Defines the starting point of the adaptation process within the model, influencing the scope of adjustments. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_at`: Defines the ending point of the adaptation process within the model, setting the limit for adjustments. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `cache_mode`: Specifies the caching strategy for the IPAdapter and potentially other models, optimizing performance and resource utilization. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `use_tiled`: A boolean flag indicating whether the adaptation process should use a tiled approach for processing. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The base model to which the IPAdapter will be applied, serving as the foundation for the enhancement process. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `image`: The image data to which the IPAdapter adjustments will be applied, serving as input for the adaptation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `attn_mask`: An optional attention mask for more focused or restricted adaptation by the IPAdapter. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `optional_ipadapter`: An optional IPAdapter model that can be provided to override the default IPAdapter selection, allowing for more customized adaptations. Type should be `IPADAPTER`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The enhanced model, after the application of the IPAdapter, showcasing improved or additional features. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `images`: The images resulting from the adaptation process, potentially modified or enhanced. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `masks`: The masks generated or used during the adaptation process, providing additional control or focus. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `ipadapter`: The IPAdapter model that was applied to the base model, detailing the specific enhancements made. Type should be `IPADAPTER`.
