        - `timestamp_prefix` (Required): A boolean flag indicating whether to prepend a timestamp to the filename, aiding in organizing and sorting the metadata files. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `counter` (Required): A boolean flag that determines whether a counter should be appended to the filename, useful for versioning or tracking multiple metadata files for the same image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
