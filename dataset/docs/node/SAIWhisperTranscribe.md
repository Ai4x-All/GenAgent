- `SAIWhisperTranscribe`: The SAIWhisperTranscribe node is designed to transcribe audio and video files using a Whisper model. It processes media files to extract audio, applies the Whisper model for transcription, and returns detailed transcription data including raw text, structured transcription frames, and additional metadata such as frame rates and counts.
    - Parameters:
        - `file_path`: The path to the media file to be transcribed. This parameter is essential for locating the file and determining its media type, which influences the transcription process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `frame_rate`: Specifies the frame rate to be used during audio extraction from video files. It affects the granularity of the transcription timestamps and frames. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `chunk_type`: Determines the segmentation type of the transcription, either by sentence or word, influencing the structure of the transcription output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `max_new_tokens`: The maximum number of new tokens to generate for the transcription. This parameter controls the length and detail level of the transcription output. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `whisper_model`: The Whisper model, processor, and device configuration used for transcription. This parameter is crucial for determining how the audio will be processed and transcribed, affecting the accuracy and quality of the transcription output. Type should be `WHISPER_MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `transcription_text`: The raw text of the transcription. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `transcription_timestamp_dict`: A dictionary mapping timestamps to transcribed text, providing a structured view of the transcription. Type should be `DICT`.
        - `transcription_frame_dict`: A dictionary mapping frame numbers to transcribed text, useful for syncing transcription with video frames. Type should be `DICT`.
        - `prompt_schedule`: A structured representation of transcription text mapped to specific frame numbers, formatted as a schedule. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `images`: A tensor of images extracted or generated during the transcription process, corresponding to video frames or placeholders for audio files. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `transcription_count`: The total number of transcription segments produced. Type should be `INT`.
        - `frame_rate`: The frame rate used for audio extraction from video files, affecting the timing of transcription frames. Type should be `INT`.
        - `frame_count`: The total number of frames in the video file, relevant for video file transcriptions. Type should be `INT`.
