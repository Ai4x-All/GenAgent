- `MaskBoundingBox+`: The MaskBoundingBox node is designed to calculate the axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) of given masks. It aims to identify the minimal rectangular area that entirely encompasses the non-zero regions of each mask, providing a foundational tool for further image processing or analysis tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `padding`: Specifies the amount of padding to add to the calculated bounding box, allowing for adjustments to the box size beyond the exact non-zero regions of the mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blur`: Defines the level of blur to apply to the mask before calculating the bounding box, potentially smoothing out irregularities and affecting the final box dimensions. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `mask`: The input mask for which the bounding box is to be calculated. This parameter is crucial for determining the area of interest within the mask and directly influences the output bounding box. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `image_optional`: An optional image parameter that, if provided, can be used in conjunction with the mask for enhanced bounding box calculations, incorporating visual context. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `MASK`: The output mask after applying the bounding box calculation, potentially adjusted for padding and blur. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `IMAGE`: An optional output image that has been cropped or adjusted based on the bounding box calculations, incorporating any specified padding or blur effects. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `x`: The x-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the calculated bounding box. Type should be `INT`.
        - `y`: The y-coordinate of the upper-left corner of the calculated bounding box. Type should be `INT`.
        - `width`: The width of the calculated bounding box. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The height of the calculated bounding box. Type should be `INT`.
