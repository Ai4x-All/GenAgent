- `RegionalIPAdapterMask __Inspire`: This node specializes in applying regional image processing adaptations using masks to influence the generation process. It enables fine-tuning of image generation by adjusting the influence of specific regions within an image, enhancing the control over the visual output.
    - Parameters:
        - `weight`: Weight determines the strength of the embedding influence within the masked region, offering a way to balance between the original and adapted aspects of the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `noise`: Noise adds a level of randomness or texture to the adaptation process within the specified region, enhancing realism or artistic effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weight_type`: Weight type defines the method of applying weight across the masked region, allowing for different strategies of influence (e.g., linear, original, channel penalty). Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_at`: Start at specifies the beginning point of the adaptation effect within the generation process, enabling phased application. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_at`: End at defines the endpoint of the adaptation effect, allowing for precise control over the duration of influence. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `unfold_batch`: Unfold batch is a boolean parameter that, when enabled, allows for batch processing of multiple images, enhancing efficiency. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `faceid_v2`: FaceID v2 is an optional boolean parameter that, when enabled, applies a second version of face identification technology for more precise adaptations. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `weight_v2`: Weight v2 allows for an alternative weighting mechanism, offering additional control over the adaptation strength. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `combine_embeds`: Combine embeds specifies the method for combining multiple embedding vectors, affecting the overall style or feature representation within the masked region. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `mask`: The mask parameter specifies the area within the image to be influenced by the IPAdapter, allowing for targeted adjustments. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `image`: The image parameter represents the target image for adaptation, serving as the canvas for regional processing. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `neg_image`: Neg image allows for specifying an image that negatively influences the generation within the masked region, offering a way to subtract certain features or styles. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `regional_ipadapter`: The output is a conditioned model or process that has been adapted based on the specified regional parameters, ready for further image generation tasks. Type should be `REGIONAL_IPADAPTER`.
