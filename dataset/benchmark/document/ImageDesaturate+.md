- `ImageDesaturate+`: The ImageDesaturate node is designed for adjusting the saturation level of an image, allowing for partial to full desaturation based on a specified method and factor. It supports different methods of calculating grayscale values, enabling nuanced control over the desaturation process.
    - Inputs:
        - `image` (Required): The input image to be desaturated. It serves as the primary data for the desaturation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `factor` (Required): A value between 0 and 1 that determines the intensity of the desaturation effect. A factor of 1 results in full desaturation, while 0 leaves the image unchanged. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `method` (Required): The method used to calculate the grayscale values during desaturation. Options include luminance (Rec.709), luminance (Rec.601), average, and lightness, each affecting the output image's appearance differently. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The desaturated image, with its saturation level adjusted according to the specified factor and method. Type should be `IMAGE`.
