- `VHS_DuplicateImages`: The `VHS_DuplicateImages` node is designed to create multiple copies of a given image batch, effectively duplicating the images a specified number of times. This functionality is crucial for operations requiring augmented data or increased dataset size without new data generation.
    - Parameters:
        - `multiply_by`: Determines the number of times the input images are duplicated. This parameter directly influences the output dataset size, allowing for flexible data augmentation. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: Specifies the batch of images to be duplicated. This input is central to the node's operation, determining the base data that will be replicated. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `IMAGE`: The duplicated batch of images, expanded according to the `multiply_by` parameter. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `count`: The total number of images in the duplicated batch, providing a straightforward count of the output dataset size. Type should be `INT`.
