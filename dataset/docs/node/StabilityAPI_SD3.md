- `StabilityAPI_SD3`: The StabilityAPI_SD3 node is designed to interface with the StabilityAI API, facilitating the generation of images or the application of transformations to existing images. It abstracts the complexities of interacting with the API, enabling users to focus on creative tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `prompt`: Accepts a textual description or prompt to guide the image generation process, influencing the visual output based on the provided text. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `n_prompt`: Specifies the number of prompts to be used, allowing for multiple prompts to influence the generation process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `seed`: A seed value for the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of the generated images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `model`: Defines the model used for image generation, allowing selection based on desired characteristics or capabilities. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `aspect_ratio`: Sets the aspect ratio of the output image, enabling control over the image's dimensions. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `output_format`: Determines the format of the output image, such as JPEG or PNG, according to user preference. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `api_key`: The API key required for accessing the StabilityAI API, ensuring authorized use. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `img2img_strength`: Controls the strength of the transformation applied to the initial image in img2img tasks, adjusting the level of change. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `disable_metadata`: Option to disable embedding metadata in the generated image, offering control over privacy and data storage. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: An initial image for img2img tasks, serving as a base for transformations or enhancements. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The generated or transformed image as a result of the node's execution. Type should be `IMAGE`.
