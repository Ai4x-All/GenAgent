- `Big Palette Switch [Dream]`: The Big Palette Switch [Dream] node is designed to dynamically select between different color palettes based on input conditions. It facilitates the flexible manipulation of color schemes within a project by allowing the selection of a palette that best fits the given criteria or context.
    - Parameters:
        - `select`: Specifies the index of the palette to select. This parameter determines which of the potentially multiple input palettes is chosen based on its index, influencing the node's output directly. Type should be `INT`.
        - `on_missing`: Defines the behavior of the node when the selected palette is missing. It can either move to the previous or next available palette, ensuring a seamless selection process even when some inputs are unavailable. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `input_i`: Represents one of the potential palette inputs from which one is selected. The index i ranges from 0 to 9, allowing for up to ten different palettes to be inputted, offering a wide range of choices. Type should be `RGB_PALETTE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `selected`: The palette that has been selected based on the input conditions. This output reflects the chosen palette after considering the 'select' and 'on_missing' parameters. Type should be `RGB_PALETTE`.
