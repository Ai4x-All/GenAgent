- `ReActorFaceSwap`: The ReActorFaceSwap node specializes in rapidly swapping faces within images, leveraging advanced face detection and swapping algorithms to achieve high-quality results. This node is designed to seamlessly integrate face swap functionalities into workflows, making it ideal for applications requiring dynamic face replacement or augmentation.
    - Parameters:
        - `enabled`: A flag to enable or disable the face swapping process, allowing for conditional execution within a workflow. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `swap_model`: The specific model used for swapping faces, which determines the quality and style of the swap. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `facedetection`: Indicates whether face detection should be performed as part of the swapping process, enabling the identification and selection of faces. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `face_restore_model`: The model used for restoring faces post-swap, ensuring high-quality and natural-looking results. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `face_restore_visibility`: Controls the visibility of the restoration process in the output, allowing for fine-tuning of the final image appearance. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `codeformer_weight`: The weight of the CodeFormer model in the restoration process, balancing between the original and enhanced face features. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `detect_gender_input`: Determines whether to detect the gender of faces in the input image, aiding in more accurate face swapping. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `detect_gender_source`: Specifies whether to detect the gender of the source face, used in gender-specific swapping scenarios. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `input_faces_index`: Indices of faces in the input image to be considered for swapping, allowing for selective processing. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `source_faces_index`: Indices of faces in the source image for swapping, enabling targeted face replacement. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `console_log_level`: Sets the verbosity level of console logs during the swapping process, aiding in debugging and monitoring. Type should be `COMBO[INT]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `input_image`: The image that will either serve as the source or target in the face swapping process, depending on the operation mode. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `source_image`: The source image providing the face(s) for swapping, central to the face replacement operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `face_model`: Specifies the face detection model to be used, impacting the accuracy of face identification. Type should be `FACE_MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting image after the face swapping operation, showcasing the swapped faces. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `face_model`: The face model used in the process, potentially updated based on the operation's requirements. Type should be `FACE_MODEL`.
