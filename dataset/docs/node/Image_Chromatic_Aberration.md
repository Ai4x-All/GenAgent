- `Image Chromatic Aberration`: This node applies a chromatic aberration effect to an image by adjusting the RGB channels' offsets and intensity, simulating the way light disperses through a lens.
    - Parameters:
        - `red_offset`: The offset value for the red channel, affecting the dispersion effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `green_offset`: The offset value for the green channel, affecting the dispersion effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blue_offset`: The offset value for the blue channel, affecting the dispersion effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `intensity`: The intensity of the chromatic aberration effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `fade_radius`: The radius over which the chromatic aberration effect fades off. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to which the chromatic aberration effect will be applied. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The image with the applied chromatic aberration effect. Type should be `IMAGE`.
