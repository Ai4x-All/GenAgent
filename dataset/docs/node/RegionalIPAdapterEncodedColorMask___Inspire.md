- `RegionalIPAdapterEncodedColorMask __Inspire`: This node specializes in applying regional image processing adaptations based on encoded color masks. It integrates specific color-based mask regions with embedding adjustments, allowing for targeted image modifications that respect the spatial and color-based constraints defined by the user.
    - Parameters:
        - `mask_color`: A string specifying the color used in the color mask to identify the regions of interest. This color acts as a key to isolate specific areas for processing. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `weight`: A float value that determines the intensity or influence of the embeddings on the adaptation process. It modulates how strongly the specified adjustments are applied. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weight_type`: Specifies the method of applying weights to the embeddings, offering options like original, linear, or channel penalty to fine-tune the adaptation effect. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_at`: A float indicating the start point (in terms of progression through layers or steps) for applying the adaptations, allowing for phased or gradual application. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_at`: A float indicating the end point for the adaptation application, enabling precise control over the extent of the modifications. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `unfold_batch`: A boolean indicating whether to unfold the batch for processing, affecting how adaptations are applied across multiple instances. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `color_mask`: The color mask image used to define regions for adaptation. It serves as a spatial guide for where the adaptations should be applied, based on color matching. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `embeds`: Embeddings that represent the desired adjustments or effects to be applied within the specified regions. These embeddings guide the adaptation process. Type should be `EMBEDS`.
        - `neg_embeds`: Optional embeddings that represent negative adjustments or effects, providing a means to specify adaptations that should be avoided or counteracted within the regions. Type should be `EMBEDS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `regional_ipadapter`: The result of the regional image processing adaptation, incorporating the specified embeddings and adjustments within the defined color mask regions. Type should be `REGIONAL_IPADAPTER`.
        - `mask`: The processed mask that was used to guide the adaptations, potentially altered based on the specified color and regions of interest. Type should be `MASK`.
