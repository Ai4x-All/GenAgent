- `CR Select Model`: The CR Select Model node is designed to select and load a specific model based on user input. It facilitates the dynamic selection of models from a predefined list, enabling users to switch between different models for their generative tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name1`: Represents the first checkpoint name option for model selection. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `ckpt_name2`: Represents the second checkpoint name option for model selection. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `ckpt_name3`: Represents the third checkpoint name option for model selection. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `ckpt_name4`: Represents the fourth checkpoint name option for model selection. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `ckpt_name5`: Represents the fifth checkpoint name option for model selection. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `select_model`: An integer input that determines which model checkpoint to load from the given options. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
