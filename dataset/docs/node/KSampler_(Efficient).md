- `KSampler (Efficient)`: The KSampler (Efficient) node is designed to efficiently sample latent images using a variety of sampling techniques, tailored to work with specific model configurations and conditioning parameters. It leverages the Comfy KSampler nodes to generate or refine latent images based on provided seeds, steps, and other relevant parameters, optimizing the process for performance without compromising on the quality of the generated images.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: A seed value to ensure reproducibility of the sampling process, affecting the randomness and variation in the generated images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Defines the number of steps to be taken in the sampling process, impacting the detail and quality of the output images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: A configuration parameter that adjusts the sampling process, influencing the generation's creativity and fidelity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Identifies the specific sampling algorithm to be used, affecting the approach and technique for generating latent images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Specifies the scheduler for the sampling process, controlling the progression of steps and their impact on image quality. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: A parameter to control the denoising level in the sampling process, affecting the clarity and sharpness of the generated images. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `preview_method`: Specifies the method used for previewing the sampling process, influencing how intermediate or final results are visualized. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `vae_decode`: Indicates whether to decode the latent image using a VAE model, affecting the final image representation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: Specifies the model to be used for sampling, playing a crucial role in determining the characteristics and quality of the generated latent images. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `positive`: Positive conditioning text to guide the image generation towards desired attributes or themes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Negative conditioning text to steer the image generation away from certain attributes or themes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent_image`: An initial latent image to be refined or modified through the sampling process, serving as a starting point for generation. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `optional_vae`: An optional VAE model that can be used for decoding, providing flexibility in the image generation process. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `script`: An optional script to customize or extend the sampling process, allowing for advanced manipulation of the generation. Type should be `SCRIPT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `MODEL`: The model used in the sampling process, potentially modified or updated. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `CONDITIONING+`: The positive conditioning information used or generated during the sampling process. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `CONDITIONING-`: The negative conditioning information used or generated during the sampling process. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `LATENT`: The output latent image(s) generated or refined by the sampling process, ready for further processing or conversion into visible images. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `VAE`: The VAE model used or referenced in the sampling process, if applicable. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `IMAGE`: The final or intermediate images generated during the sampling process, as determined by the preview method and other parameters. Type should be `IMAGE`.
