- `ApplyInstantIDControlNet`: This node is designed to apply a control network to modify facial embeddings based on specified conditions, leveraging insights from facial analysis and control network parameters to achieve targeted modifications in facial representations.
    - Parameters:
        - `strength`: The intensity of the modifications applied by the control network. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_at`: The starting point in the process where modifications begin to be applied. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_at`: The ending point in the process where modifications cease to be applied. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `face_embeds`: Facial embeddings that represent the key features of a face, serving as the input for targeted modifications. Type should be `FACE_EMBEDS`.
        - `control_net`: The control network model used to apply modifications to the facial embeddings. Type should be `CONTROL_NET`.
        - `image_kps`: Key points from the image that are used to guide the modifications applied by the control network. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `positive`: Positive conditioning phrases or keywords that guide the direction of the modifications. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Negative conditioning phrases or keywords that specify undesired attributes to be avoided in the modifications. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `mask`: An optional mask that can be used to localize the modifications applied by the control network. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `positive`: The modified positive conditioning after applying the control network, reflecting the targeted modifications. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: The modified negative conditioning after applying the control network, reflecting the avoidance of specified undesired attributes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
