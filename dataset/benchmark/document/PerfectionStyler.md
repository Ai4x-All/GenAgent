Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_negative` (Required): The 'text_negative' input is used to specify undesired elements or themes in the generated image. It plays a significant role in refining the output by preventing certain aspects from appearing, thus ensuring that the final image aligns more closely with the user's vision. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `camera` (Required): The 'camera' input allows users to specify preferences related to camera settings, such as angle and focus, to influence the visual perspective of the generated image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `composition` (Required): This input enables users to define the composition of the image, including the arrangement of subjects and objects, to create a balanced and engaging visual. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `depth` (Required): The 'depth' input helps in adjusting the perceived depth of the image, enhancing the 3D effect and the spatial relationship between elements. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `environment` (Required): Users can specify the environmental settings, such as indoor or outdoor, weather conditions, and time of day, to match the desired context of the image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `filter` (Required): This input allows for the application of visual filters to alter the color, contrast, and overall mood of the image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `focus` (Required): The 'focus' input controls the focus area of the image, highlighting specific subjects or blurring backgrounds to draw attention. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lighting` (Required): Users can specify lighting conditions, such as the direction and intensity of light, to enhance the realism and mood of the image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `mood` (Required): The 'mood' input allows users to convey the desired emotional tone or atmosphere of the image, influencing its thematic direction. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `subject` (Required): This input specifies the main subject of the image, such as a person, object, or scene, to ensure it aligns with the user's vision. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `theme` (Required): The 'theme' input enables users to define a specific theme or concept for the image, guiding its stylistic and compositional direction. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `timeofday` (Required): Users can specify the time of day for the image, affecting lighting, shadows, and overall ambiance. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `log_prompt` (Required): The 'log_prompt' input is an optional parameter that enables logging of the transformation process. It provides insights into how the initial prompts are modified and stylized, offering transparency and understanding of the node's operation. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Outputs:
        - `text_positive`: The modified 'text_positive' output reflects the enhanced and stylized version of the initial prompt, incorporating the stylistic adjustments made by the node to better capture the desired imagery and themes. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_negative`: The modified 'text_negative' output provides an updated list of undesired elements or themes, refined during the stylization process to ensure the final image more accurately reflects the user's preferences. Type should be `STRING`.
