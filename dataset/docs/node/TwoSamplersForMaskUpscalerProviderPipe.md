- `TwoSamplersForMaskUpscalerProviderPipe`: This node is designed to provide a pipeline that integrates two distinct samplers specifically for the purpose of upscaling masks. It facilitates the enhancement of image quality by applying specialized sampling techniques to areas designated by masks, thereby improving the overall visual impact of the images.
    - Parameters:
        - `scale_method`: Specifies the method used for scaling during the upscaling process. It influences how the image is enlarged and the quality of the upscaling. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `full_sample_schedule`: Defines the schedule for sampling throughout the upscaling process. It determines the sequence and parameters for sampling operations. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `use_tiled_vae`: Indicates whether a tiled VAE approach is used for upscaling. This affects the handling of large images by breaking them into tiles for processing. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `tile_size`: The size of the tiles used when a tiled VAE approach is employed. It specifies the dimensions for breaking down large images. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
