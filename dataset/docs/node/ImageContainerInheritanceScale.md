- `ImageContainerInheritanceScale`: This node is designed to scale images based on specified width and height scaling factors. It adjusts the dimensions of the input images and then applies additional image processing operations, such as color adjustments, through subsequent nodes.
    - Parameters:
        - `scale_width`: The factor by which the width of the input images is to be scaled. This directly influences the resulting image width. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `scale_height`: The factor by which the height of the input images is to be scaled. This directly influences the resulting image height. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `red`: The red color component to be applied to the images. This affects the overall color balance of the output images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `green`: The green color component to be applied to the images. This affects the overall color balance of the output images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blue`: The blue color component to be applied to the images. This affects the overall color balance of the output images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha`: The alpha (transparency) value to be applied to the images. This determines the opacity of the output images. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `method`: The method used for scaling and applying color adjustments. This parameter dictates the specific algorithm or technique used. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The input images to be scaled. This parameter is crucial as it provides the raw data for the scaling operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output of the node is an image or a set of images that have been scaled and had color adjustments applied according to the specified parameters. Type should be `IMAGE`.
