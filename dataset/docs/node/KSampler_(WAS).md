- `KSampler (WAS)`: The KSampler node is designed for advanced sampling in generative models, allowing for the customization of the sampling process through various parameters. It integrates with the broader WAS Suite to provide a flexible and powerful tool for generating and manipulating latent representations.
    - Parameters:
        - `steps`: The number of steps to perform in the sampling process, affecting the detail and quality of the generated samples. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: A configuration parameter that adjusts the sampling process, allowing for fine-tuning of the generation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Specifies the particular sampler to use, enabling the selection of different sampling strategies. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Determines the scheduling algorithm for the sampling process, impacting how samples evolve over time. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: Controls the denoising level in the sampling process, affecting the clarity and sharpness of the generated samples. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The generative model used for sampling. It's crucial for defining the behavior and output of the sampling process. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `seed`: A seed value to ensure reproducibility of the sampling results. It influences the randomness of the generated samples. Type should be `SEED`.
        - `positive`: Positive conditioning to guide the sampling towards desired attributes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Negative conditioning to steer the sampling away from certain attributes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent_image`: An optional latent image to start the sampling from, allowing for modifications or enhancements of existing images. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The output latent representation generated by the sampling process, which can be further used or transformed. Type should be `LATENT`.
