- `TiledKSamplerProvider`: The TiledKSamplerProvider node is designed to facilitate the use of tiled sampling techniques within the ComfyUI framework. It dynamically integrates with the 'TiledKSampler' custom node, ensuring compatibility and extending functionality for advanced image generation tasks. This node acts as a bridge, enabling users to leverage tiled sampling strategies for improved performance and quality in image synthesis.
