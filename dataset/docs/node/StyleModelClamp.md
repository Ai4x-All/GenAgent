- `StyleModelClamp`: The StyleModelClamp node is designed to pass through style model data without modification, serving as a placeholder or checkpoint within a data processing pipeline. It ensures the integrity and continuity of style model information as it flows through different stages of processing.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `style_model`: The 'style_model' input represents the style model data to be clamped. This parameter is crucial for maintaining the flow of style model information through the node without alteration. Type should be `STYLE_MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `style_model`: The output is the unmodified style model data, ensuring that the integrity of the style model information is preserved as it passes through the node. Type should be `STYLE_MODEL`.
