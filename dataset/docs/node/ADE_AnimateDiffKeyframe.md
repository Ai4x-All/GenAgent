- `ADE_AnimateDiffKeyframe`: The node is designed to manage and apply keyframe configurations for animation effects within the AnimateDiff framework. It allows for the dynamic adjustment of animation parameters such as scale, effect intensity, and camera control settings at specific points in the animation timeline, enhancing the flexibility and expressiveness of the animation process.
    - Parameters:
        - `start_percent`: Specifies the starting point of the keyframe within the animation timeline as a percentage, dictating when the keyframe's effects begin to apply. This parameter is crucial for timing the application of animation effects precisely. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `inherit_missing`: Indicates whether the keyframe should inherit unspecified parameters from previous keyframes, ensuring continuity in the animation effects. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `guarantee_steps`: Guarantees a minimum number of steps for which the keyframe's effects are applied, ensuring that certain effects persist for a desired duration within the animation. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `prev_ad_keyframes`: Allows for the inclusion of previous animation keyframes to be considered or modified in the current operation, enabling continuity and layering of animation effects. Type should be `AD_KEYFRAMES`.
        - `scale_multival`: Determines the scaling factor to be applied to the animation at this keyframe, affecting the size or zoom level of the animated elements. Type should be `MULTIVAL`.
        - `effect_multival`: Controls the intensity of specific visual effects applied at this keyframe, allowing for dynamic visual transformations throughout the animation. Type should be `MULTIVAL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `ad_keyframes`: Returns an updated collection of keyframes, including the newly added or modified keyframe, facilitating the management and sequencing of animation effects. Type should be `AD_KEYFRAMES`.
