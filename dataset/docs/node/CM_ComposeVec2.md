- `CM_ComposeVec2`: The CM_ComposeVec2 node is designed to construct a 2-dimensional vector from individual scalar components, facilitating the conversion of separate scalar values into a structured vector format.
    - Parameters:
        - `x`: The 'x' parameter represents the x-coordinate of the 2-dimensional vector. It plays a crucial role in defining the vector's horizontal component. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `y`: The 'y' parameter represents the y-coordinate of the 2-dimensional vector. It is essential for defining the vector's vertical component. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `vec2`: Outputs a 2-dimensional vector constructed from the input scalar values, encapsulating both the horizontal and vertical components. Type should be `VEC2`.
