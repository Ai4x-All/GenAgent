- `LoraLoader`: The LoraLoader node is designed to dynamically load and apply LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adjustments to models and CLIP instances based on specified parameters. It facilitates the customization of model behavior and performance without altering the original model architecture, enabling fine-tuned control over model and CLIP instance characteristics through LoRA parameters.
    - Inputs:
        - `model` (Required): The model to which LoRA adjustments will be applied. It is crucial for defining the base model that will be modified. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip` (Required): The CLIP instance to which LoRA adjustments will be applied. This parameter allows for the modification of CLIP instances alongside models. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `lora_name` (Required): The name of the LoRA file to be loaded. This determines which LoRA adjustments are applied to the model and CLIP instance. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `strength_model` (Required): Defines the strength of LoRA adjustments applied to the model. This parameter allows for fine-tuning the impact of LoRA on the model. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `strength_clip` (Required): Defines the strength of LoRA adjustments applied to the CLIP instance. This parameter allows for adjusting the influence of LoRA on the CLIP instance. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The modified model with LoRA adjustments applied. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The modified CLIP instance with LoRA adjustments applied. Type should be `CLIP`.
