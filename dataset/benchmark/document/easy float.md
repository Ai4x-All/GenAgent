- `easy float`: The `easy float` node provides a simplified interface for working with floating-point values within a user-defined range. It allows for the adjustment of parameters such as weight, strength, and other numerical values with precision, facilitating fine-tuned control over these settings in various applications.
    - Inputs:
        - `value` (Required): Specifies the floating-point value to be processed. This parameter allows users to input a numerical value for manipulation or evaluation within the node's functionality. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `float`: Returns the processed floating-point value, potentially adjusted or evaluated based on the node's logic. Type should be `FLOAT`.
