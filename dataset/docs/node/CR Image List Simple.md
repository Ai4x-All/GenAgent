- `CR Image List Simple`: The CR Image List Simple node is designed to create a simple list of images from a specified set of individual images. It allows for the aggregation of multiple image inputs into a single list, facilitating operations that require a collection of images as input.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `image_1`: Represents the first image to be included in the list. Its inclusion is optional but adds to the versatility of the list by allowing for a varied collection of images. Including this image can initiate or extend the list, affecting the node's execution by potentially increasing the diversity of images processed. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_2`: Represents the second image to be included in the list. Including this image expands the list and increases the potential for diverse image processing applications. It affects the node's execution by adding more variety to the list, which can influence subsequent image processing tasks. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_3`: Represents the third image to be included in the list. Its inclusion enhances the list's capacity for handling multiple images in sequence or batch operations. This can affect the node's execution by enabling more complex sequences or batches of images to be processed together. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_4`: Represents the fourth image to be included in the list. Adding this image further diversifies the list's content, enabling more complex image-based workflows. It influences the node's execution by contributing to the richness and complexity of the image collection. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_5`: Represents the fifth image to be included in the list. Its inclusion completes the list, offering a comprehensive set of images for processing or analysis. This affects the node's execution by potentially completing or rounding out the collection of images, which may be critical for certain analyses or processing tasks. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image_list_simple`: An optional pre-existing list of images that can be extended with additional images specified by the other inputs. This parameter allows for the dynamic expansion of the image list based on varying requirements. Including or extending this list directly impacts the node's execution by modifying the initial set of images to be processed, thereby affecting the outcome. Type should be `IMAGE_LIST_SIMPLE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `IMAGE_LIST_SIMPLE`: The compiled list of images, which may include a combination of individually specified images and those from an existing list. This list is ready for further processing or analysis. Type should be `IMAGE_LIST_SIMPLE`.
        - `show_help`: Provides a URL to the help documentation for this node, offering users guidance on its usage and capabilities. Type should be `STRING`.
