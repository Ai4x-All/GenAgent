- `ImpactControlNetApplySEGS`: This node applies a control network to segmentation data (SEGS), adjusting the segmentation according to the control network's parameters and potentially an additional control image. It's designed to modify segmentation outputs based on specified controls, enhancing or altering the segmentation results in a targeted manner.
    - Parameters:
        - `strength`: A scalar value that determines the intensity of the control network's effect on the segmentation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `segs`: The segmentation data to be modified. It's the primary input over which the control network's effects are applied. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `control_net`: The control network to apply to the segmentation data. It defines how the segmentation should be adjusted. Type should be `CONTROL_NET`.
        - `segs_preprocessor`: An optional preprocessor for the segmentation data before applying the control network. Type should be `SEGS_PREPROCESSOR`.
        - `control_image`: An optional image that can influence the control network's application to the segmentation data. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `segs`: The modified segmentation data after applying the control network. Type should be `SEGS`.
