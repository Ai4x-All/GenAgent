- `ImageDrawArcByContainer`: This node is designed to draw an arc on an image based on the specifications provided within a container. It leverages the dimensions and properties of the container to accurately render the arc, incorporating parameters such as size, start and end points, color, and drawing method to customize the output.
    - Parameters:
        - `size`: Defines the thickness of the arc to be drawn on the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_x`: The x-coordinate of the starting point of the arc. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_y`: The y-coordinate of the starting point of the arc. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_x`: The x-coordinate of the ending point of the arc. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_y`: The y-coordinate of the ending point of the arc. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start`: The starting angle of the arc. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end`: The ending angle of the arc. Type should be `INT`.
        - `red`: The red component of the color of the arc. Type should be `INT`.
        - `green`: The green component of the color of the arc. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blue`: The blue component of the color of the arc. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha`: The alpha (transparency) level of the arc's color. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `SSAA`: Specifies the level of supersampling anti-aliasing (SSAA) applied to the arc, enhancing the visual quality. Type should be `INT`.
        - `method`: The method used for drawing the arc, affecting the rendering technique. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `container`: The container input specifies the image on which the arc will be drawn, providing essential dimensions and properties for the drawing operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is an image with the specified arc drawn on it, reflecting the input parameters and modifications. Type should be `IMAGE`.
