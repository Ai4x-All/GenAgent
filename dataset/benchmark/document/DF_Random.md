- `DF_Random`: The `DF_Random` node generates a random floating-point number within a specified range. It utilizes a seed for reproducible randomness, allowing for consistent results across multiple executions.
    - Inputs:
        - `Value_A` (Required): Specifies the lower bound of the random number range. It influences the minimum value that the random number generator can produce. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `Value_B` (Required): Defines the upper bound of the random number range. It sets the maximum value that the random number generator can output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `seed` (Required): A seed value for the random number generator to ensure reproducibility of results. It determines the sequence of numbers generated, allowing for consistent randomness across runs. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `float`: The output is a random floating-point number within the specified range, determined by the input bounds and seed. Type should be `FLOAT`.
