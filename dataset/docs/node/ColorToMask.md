- `ColorToMask`: The ColorToMask node is designed to convert a specified RGB color in an image to a mask. This process involves analyzing the image to identify pixels that match the given RGB values and creating a mask based on these pixels. It supports batch processing, allowing multiple images to be processed simultaneously with control over the batch size.
    - Parameters:
        - `invert`: A boolean flag to invert the mask. When set to True, the areas not matching the specified RGB color will be masked instead. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `red`: The red component of the RGB color to be converted to a mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `green`: The green component of the RGB color to be converted to a mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blue`: The blue component of the RGB color to be converted to a mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `threshold`: The threshold for color matching. Pixels within this threshold of the specified RGB color will be included in the mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `per_batch`: Controls the number of images processed in a single batch, allowing for efficient batch processing of images. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The images to be processed. This parameter is crucial for defining the input images on which the RGB to mask conversion will be performed. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The output mask generated by identifying pixels that match the specified RGB color within the threshold. Type should be `MASK`.
