- `RegionalIPAdapterEncodedMask __Inspire`: This node specializes in applying encoded mask-based image processing adjustments within the InspirePack framework, leveraging regional IP adapter techniques to conditionally modify image embeddings based on specified masks and weights.
    - Parameters:
        - `weight`: A float value that determines the intensity of the embedding adjustments applied to the image, allowing for fine-tuning of the effect strength. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weight_type`: Specifies the method of applying weights to the embeddings, offering options like original, linear, or channel penalty for diverse adjustment effects. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_at`: Defines the starting point of the effect application in terms of image processing, enabling phased adjustments. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_at`: Sets the endpoint for the effect application, allowing for precise control over the extent of the adjustments. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `unfold_batch`: A boolean flag that, when true, processes each item in a batch individually, enhancing flexibility in handling batched inputs. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `mask`: The mask input specifies areas of the image to be targeted for conditional embedding adjustments, playing a crucial role in the node's operation by defining regions for focused processing. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `embeds`: Embeddings that represent the desired adjustments or features to be applied to the specified regions of the image, influencing the final output based on the mask. Type should be `EMBEDS`.
        - `neg_embeds`: Optional negative embeddings that can be used to specify features or adjustments to be avoided in the specified regions, adding an inverse effect capability. Type should be `EMBEDS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `regional_ipadapter`: Produces a conditioned version of the input based on the encoded mask and specified parameters, reflecting the targeted adjustments. Type should be `REGIONAL_IPADAPTER`.
