- `ttN multiModelMerge`: The node `ttN_multiModelMerge` is designed to facilitate the merging of multiple models and/or CLIP models based on specified configurations and interpolation ratios. It abstracts the complexities involved in model merging, allowing for flexible integration and manipulation of model attributes to achieve desired outcomes.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_A_name`: This parameter specifies the name of the first checkpoint file to be merged. It is crucial for identifying the primary model whose attributes will be combined with another model. The choice of checkpoint directly influences the base characteristics of the merged model, impacting its performance and capabilities. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `config_A_name`: This parameter indicates the configuration name associated with the first model. It plays a key role in determining how the model's attributes are to be merged and manipulated. The configuration settings define the operational parameters of the model, affecting the merging process's outcome by dictating how attributes are integrated. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `ckpt_B_name`: This parameter specifies the name of the second checkpoint file to be merged. It serves as the secondary source of model attributes that will be integrated into the primary model. The selection of this checkpoint influences the additional capabilities and features that will be added to the merged model, shaping its final form. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `config_B_name`: This parameter indicates the configuration name associated with the second model. It is essential for guiding the merging process and ensuring the desired outcome is achieved. The configuration details provide a blueprint for how the second model's attributes are to be combined with the first, affecting the merged model's functionality and performance.
