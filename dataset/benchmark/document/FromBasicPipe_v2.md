- `FromBasicPipe_v2`: The `FromBasicPipe_v2` node is designed to decompose a basic pipeline into its constituent components, facilitating access to individual elements such as models, clips, and conditioning parameters for further processing or analysis.
    - Inputs:
        - `basic_pipe` (Required): Represents the basic pipeline to be decomposed into its individual components, enabling detailed examination and manipulation of each element. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `basic_pipe`: Returns the original basic pipeline as received in the input, allowing for its reuse or further manipulation. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
        - `model`: Extracts the model component from the basic pipeline for independent use or analysis. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: Retrieves the CLIP model from the basic pipeline, making it available for separate operations. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `vae`: Isolates the VAE model from the basic pipeline for individual application or study. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `positive`: Separates the positive conditioning parameter from the basic pipeline, providing it for distinct processing or examination. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Separates the negative conditioning parameter from the basic pipeline, offering it for individual utilization or analysis. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
