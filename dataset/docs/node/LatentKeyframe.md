- `LatentKeyframe`: The LatentKeyframe node is designed for managing and manipulating keyframes within a latent space, specifically for controlling the progression and transformation of generative models' outputs over time. It allows for the loading and updating of keyframe data, facilitating the creation of smooth transitions and animations in generated content.
    - Parameters:
        - `batch_index`: Specifies the index of the batch for which the keyframe is being loaded or manipulated, serving as a key identifier for operations within the batch. Type should be `INT`.
        - `strength`: Determines the intensity or influence of the keyframe on the generated output, allowing for fine-tuned control over the appearance or characteristics of the generated content. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `prev_latent_kf`: An optional parameter that allows for the chaining or sequencing of keyframes by providing a reference to a previously defined keyframe or keyframe group, enabling complex animations and transitions. Type should be `LATENT_KEYFRAME`.
    - Outputs:
        - `LATENT_KF`: Represents the updated or newly created keyframe or keyframe group, encapsulating the changes made through the node's operation. Type should be `LATENT_KEYFRAME`.
