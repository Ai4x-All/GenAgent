- `TiledKSamplerProvider`: The TiledKSamplerProvider node is designed to facilitate the generation of samples using a tiled K-sampling approach. It configures and utilizes a specialized sampler that operates on tiles of an image, allowing for efficient and scalable image generation with customizable sampling strategies.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: Specifies the initial seed for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the sampling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Determines the number of steps to be taken in the sampling process, affecting the detail and quality of the generated image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Controls the configuration setting for the sampling process, influencing the behavior and characteristics of the generated samples. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Selects the specific K-sampler to be used, allowing for flexibility in choosing the sampling algorithm. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Chooses the scheduler for controlling the sampling process, enabling fine-tuning of the sampling dynamics. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: Adjusts the denoising factor applied during sampling, impacting the clarity and noise level of the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `tile_width`: Sets the width of the tiles used in the sampling process, defining the granularity of the tiled approach. Type should be `INT`.
        - `tile_height`: Sets the height of the tiles used in the sampling process, defining the granularity of the tiled approach. Type should be `INT`.
        - `tiling_strategy`: Determines the strategy for tiling the image during sampling, affecting the overall sampling pattern and efficiency. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `basic_pipe`: Provides the basic pipeline components required for the sampling process, including the model and positive/negative conditioning. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `ksampler`: Returns a configured KSampler instance ready for sampling operations. Type should be `KSAMPLER`.
