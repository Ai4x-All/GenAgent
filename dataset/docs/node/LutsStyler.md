    - Parameters:
        - `text_positive`: The positive text prompt to be styled. It serves as the base content that will be transformed according to the selected LUT style, affecting the overall tone and theme. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `text_negative`: The negative text prompt to be styled. This input works alongside the positive prompt, allowing for a nuanced adjustment of the text's style by applying the selected LUT to diminish or negate certain aspects. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `LUTs`: The specific Look-Up Table (LUT) selections to apply to the text prompts. This input determines the stylistic filter that will be used to transform the text, directly influencing the final aesthetic and thematic output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `log_prompt`: A boolean flag that controls the logging of prompt transformations. When enabled, it provides visibility into the styling process by outputting the original and transformed prompts, aiding in debugging and refinement. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
