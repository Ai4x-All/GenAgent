- `CM_FloatToInt`: The CM_FloatToInt node is designed for mathematical conversion operations, specifically converting floating-point numbers to integers. It abstracts the process of type conversion in mathematical computations, facilitating the transition between different numerical types.
    - Inputs:
        - `a` (Required): The floating-point number to be converted into an integer. This parameter is crucial as it directly influences the outcome of the conversion process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `int`: The integer result obtained from converting the input floating-point number. Type should be `INT`.
