- `IF_ImagePrompt`: The IF_ImagePrompt node transforms visual inputs into textual prompts, leveraging user profiles and image characteristics to generate tailored text descriptions. It encapsulates the process of interpreting images, applying thematic embellishments, and incorporating stylistic or negative prompts to produce rich, context-aware textual outputs.
    - Parameters:
        - `image_prompt`: The initial prompt related to the image, which can be empty or filled based on the user's input, influencing the direction of the generated text. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `base_ip`: The IP address of the server where the AI engine is hosted, facilitating remote processing and generation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `port`: The port number on the server for accessing the AI engine, ensuring proper communication and data exchange. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `engine`: Specifies the AI engine used for generating the textual prompt, allowing for flexibility in choosing the underlying technology. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `profile`: A user profile that influences the thematic direction and content of the generated text, personalizing the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `embellish_prompt`: A thematic embellishment added to the prompt to enrich the textual output with specific themes or ideas. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `style_prompt`: A stylistic overlay for the prompt, guiding the tone or style of the generated text to match desired aesthetics. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `neg_prompt`: A negative prompt used to steer the generated text away from certain themes or concepts, enhancing content control. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `temperature`: Controls the creativity of the AI's responses, affecting the variability and unpredictability of the generated text. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `max_tokens`: Sets the maximum length of the generated text, ensuring outputs are within desired constraints. Type should be `INT`.
        - `seed`: A seed value for the random number generator, enabling reproducible outputs in the text generation process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `random`: A flag indicating whether to introduce randomness into the text generation, adding an element of unpredictability. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `keep_alive`: Determines whether the connection to the AI engine should be maintained after the request, optimizing for repeated use. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The visual input for which a textual prompt is generated. It supports various formats including torch.Tensor, PIL.Image, or a file path, making it versatile for different input sources. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `selected_model`: Determines the specific model within the chosen engine to use for text generation, enabling fine-tuned control over the output. Type should be `[]`.
    - Outputs:
        - `Question`: The initial image prompt or question derived from the input image and user profile, setting the context for the generated text. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `Response`: The main body of the generated text, enriched with embellishments, style, and thematic content based on the input prompts. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `Negative`: A segment of the generated text that specifically addresses the negative prompt, ensuring certain themes or concepts are avoided. Type should be `STRING`.
