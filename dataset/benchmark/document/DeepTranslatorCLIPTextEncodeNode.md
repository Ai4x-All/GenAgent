- `DeepTranslatorCLIPTextEncodeNode`: This node is designed to encode text inputs using a deep translation mechanism combined with CLIP text encoding, facilitating the translation of text into different languages before encoding it into a format suitable for conditioning models. It serves as a foundational component for nodes that require text translation and encoding capabilities for further processing or model conditioning.
    - Inputs:
        - `from_translate` (Required): Specifies the source language of the text to be translated. It plays a crucial role in determining the initial language from which the text will be translated, affecting the accuracy and relevance of the translation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `to_translate` (Required): Defines the target language to which the text will be translated. This parameter is essential for guiding the translation process towards the desired language, impacting the final output's applicability for specific linguistic contexts. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `add_proxies` (Required): Indicates whether proxies should be added to the translation request, enabling the bypass of potential network restrictions. Type should be `[[True, False]]`.
        - `proxies` (Required): Specifies the proxy settings to be used if 'add_proxies' is true, facilitating the translation request through specified network paths. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `auth_data` (Required): Authentication data required for accessing the translation service, ensuring secure and authorized translation requests. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `service` (Required): The translation service to be used, such as 'GoogleTranslator' or another supported service, determining the translation mechanism and capabilities. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `text` (Required): The text input to be translated and encoded. This parameter is central to the node's functionality, as it provides the raw content for translation and subsequent encoding. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `clip` (Required): A CLIP model instance used for text encoding. It is crucial for converting the translated text into a format compatible with conditioning models, enhancing the text's utility for model inputs. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: The encoded representation of the translated text, suitable for use as conditioning input in various models. It includes both the conditioning vectors and pooled output for comprehensive model conditioning. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `string`: The translated text, providing a direct linguistic output of the translation process. It serves as a readable representation of the text after translation, useful for verification or further processing. Type should be `STRING`.
