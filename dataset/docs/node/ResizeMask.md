- `ResizeMask`: The ResizeMask node is designed to adjust the size of a given mask or a batch of masks to specified dimensions, optionally maintaining the original proportions. It is a key component in image processing workflows where mask dimensions need to be standardized or adjusted for further processing.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: The target width for the resizing operation. It defines the horizontal dimension of the output mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The target height for the resizing operation. It defines the vertical dimension of the output mask. Type should be `INT`.
        - `keep_proportions`: A boolean flag indicating whether to maintain the original proportions of the mask during resizing. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `mask`: The input mask or batch of masks to be resized. This parameter is central to the node's operation, as it directly influences the output size and proportions of the mask. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The resized mask or batch of masks. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `width`: The actual width of the resized mask, which may differ from the input target width if proportions are kept. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The actual height of the resized mask, which may differ from the input target height if proportions are kept. Type should be `INT`.
