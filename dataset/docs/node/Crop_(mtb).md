- `Crop (mtb)`: The Crop node in the MTB (Mask to Bounding Box) suite is designed to perform image cropping operations based on specified parameters such as bounding boxes or masks. It allows for precise extraction of image regions, supporting functionalities like border blending for seamless integration of cropped areas into new contexts.
    - Parameters:
        - `x`: The x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the cropping area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `y`: The y-coordinate of the top-left corner of the cropping area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `width`: The width of the cropping area. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The height of the cropping area. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be cropped. This is the primary data upon which the cropping operation is performed, determining the area of focus for the operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: An optional mask that can be used to define the cropping area more precisely, allowing for more complex shapes beyond simple rectangular regions. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `bbox`: An optional bounding box that specifies the cropping area. If provided, it overrides the x, y, width, and height parameters. Type should be `BBOX`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting image after the cropping operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: The mask corresponding to the cropped area, if a mask was provided as input. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `bbox`: The coordinates and dimensions of the cropping area. Type should be `BBOX`.
