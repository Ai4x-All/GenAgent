- `ImpactWildcardEncode`: The ImpactWildcardEncode node is designed to dynamically replace placeholders within a string with actual values based on a predefined set of rules and dictionaries. It leverages patterns and wildcards to identify placeholders and uses a combination of random selection and specific matching criteria to determine the replacement values, thereby enabling the generation of customized and varied outputs.
    - Parameters:
        - `wildcard_text`: The input string containing placeholders that need to be dynamically replaced. Its role is crucial as it serves as the template for the output generation, dictating where and how replacements should occur. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `populated_text`: The text resulting from the replacement of wildcards in the wildcard_text. It represents the final output of the node's processing. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `mode`: Determines the mode of operation, either populating the text with dynamic content or keeping it fixed, thus affecting the processing strategy. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `Select to add LoRA`: Allows the selection of LoRA to be added to the text, influencing the customization and specificity of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `Select to add Wildcard`: Enables the selection of additional wildcards to be incorporated into the text, further customizing the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed`: A numerical seed that influences the randomness of wildcard replacements, ensuring reproducibility or variation in outputs. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: This parameter specifies the model to be used in the process, playing a crucial role in determining the output based on the model's capabilities and characteristics. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The clip parameter is used to specify the clip to be used alongside the model, affecting the final output by providing additional context or constraints. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The model parameter output, potentially modified or selected based on the input conditions. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The clip parameter output, which may be adjusted or chosen as part of the processing. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `conditioning`: Represents additional conditioning information derived from the processing, affecting the final output. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `populated_text`: The text with placeholders replaced by actual values, reflecting the dynamic content generation based on the provided options. Type should be `STRING`.
