- `CAIN VFI`: The CAIN_VFI node is designed for video frame interpolation, leveraging deep learning models to predict intermediate frames between existing ones in a video sequence. It focuses on enhancing video fluidity and frame rate by generating high-quality intermediate frames.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: Specifies the checkpoint name for loading the pre-trained CAIN model, which is essential for initializing the model with learned weights for frame interpolation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clear_cache_after_n_frames`: Determines after how many frames the cache should be cleared to manage memory usage efficiently during the interpolation process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `multiplier`: Defines the factor by which the frame rate is to be increased, indicating how many intermediate frames are to be generated between each pair of original frames. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `frames`: The input frames to be interpolated. This tensor contains the consecutive frames between which the intermediate frames are to be generated. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `optional_interpolation_states`: Allows for the passing of optional states that can influence the interpolation process, providing flexibility in handling different interpolation scenarios. Type should be `INTERPOLATION_STATES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output tensor containing the interpolated frames, enhancing the video's fluidity by filling in the gaps between original frames. Type should be `IMAGE`.
