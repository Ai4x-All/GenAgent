- `Mikey Sampler Tiled`: The Mikey Sampler Tiled node is designed for generating tiled samples in a structured manner, leveraging advanced sampling techniques to ensure consistency and quality across tiles. It focuses on creating seamless and coherent outputs by efficiently managing the sampling process across different sections of an image or pattern.
    - Parameters:
        - `model_name`: The name of the model used for upscaling the tiles. This parameter allows for the selection of a specific model tailored to the requirements of the upscaling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed`: A seed value for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the sampling process. It allows for consistent generation of tiles across different runs. Type should be `INT`.
        - `upscale_by`: The factor by which the tiles are upscaled. This parameter controls the resolution enhancement of the tiles, affecting the clarity and detail of the final output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `tiler_denoise`: The denoising factor applied during the tiling process. It helps in reducing noise and artifacts in the tiles, improving the overall quality of the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `tiler_model`: Specifies whether the base or refiner model is used for tiling. This choice affects the characteristics and quality of the generated tiles. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `base_model`: Specifies the base model used for generating the initial samples. This model forms the foundation of the sampling process, influencing the overall quality and characteristics of the generated tiles. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `refiner_model`: Defines the model used for refining the initial samples. The refiner model enhances the details and coherence of the tiles, ensuring a seamless integration across the tiled output. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `samples`: Represents the latent representations of the initial samples. These latents are the starting point for the sampling process, serving as the basis for generating and refining the tiles. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `vae`: The variational autoencoder used in conjunction with the base and refiner models. It plays a crucial role in encoding and decoding the samples, facilitating the generation and refinement of tiles. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `positive_cond_base`: The positive conditioning applied to the base model. This conditioning guides the base model towards generating samples that align with the desired attributes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative_cond_base`: The negative conditioning applied to the base model. It steers the base model away from generating samples with undesired attributes, ensuring the quality of the initial tiles. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `positive_cond_refiner`: The positive conditioning for the refiner model. It influences the refinement process, encouraging the model to enhance the tiles in a way that aligns with the desired outcomes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative_cond_refiner`: The negative conditioning for the refiner model. It helps in avoiding the enhancement of undesired attributes during the refinement process, maintaining the integrity of the tiles. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `tiled_image`: The final tiled image generated by the node. It represents a coherent and seamless assembly of individually processed tiles. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `upscaled_image`: The upscaled version of the tiled image. This output showcases the enhanced resolution and detail achieved through the upscaling process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
