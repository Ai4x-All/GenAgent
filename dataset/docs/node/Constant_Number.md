- `Constant Number`: This node is designed to process numerical inputs and convert them based on specified types, such as integer, float, or boolean. It allows for the transformation of a number or textual representation of a number into a constant value of a specified type, supporting operations like type conversion and value adjustment.
    - Parameters:
        - `number_type`: Specifies the desired type for the output number, allowing for conversion between integer, float, and boolean types, which affects how the input number is processed and converted. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `number`: The numerical value to be processed or converted. This value serves as the base for any type conversion or adjustment operations performed by the node. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `number_as_text`: An optional textual representation of a number that, if provided, will be converted according to the specified 'number_type'. This allows for textual input to be dynamically interpreted and processed as a numerical value. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `number`: The processed or converted number in the specified 'number_type', demonstrating the node's ability to adjust and convert numerical values effectively. Type should be `NUMBER`.
        - `float`: The float representation of the processed or converted number. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `int`: The integer representation of the processed or converted number. Type should be `INT`.
