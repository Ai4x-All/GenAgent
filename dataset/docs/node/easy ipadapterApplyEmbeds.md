- `easy ipadapterApplyEmbeds`: This node is designed for applying embedding adjustments to models using IPAdapter, facilitating the integration of specific embeddings into the model's processing pipeline. It abstracts the complexity of embedding manipulation, offering a streamlined approach to enhance model performance with tailored embeddings.
    - Parameters:
        - `weight`: Specifies the weight of the embeddings in the adjustment process, influencing the degree to which the embeddings affect the model. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weight_type`: Defines the type of weighting applied to the embeddings, affecting how they are integrated into the model. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_at`: The starting point in the model's layers or processing stages where the embeddings begin to be applied, determining the scope of their impact. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_at`: The ending point in the model's layers or processing stages where the embeddings cease to be applied, marking the limit of their influence. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `embeds_scaling`: Describes how the embeddings are scaled or adjusted before being applied, impacting the final embedding integration. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
