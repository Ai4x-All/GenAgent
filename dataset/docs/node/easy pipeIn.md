- `easy pipeIn`: The `pipeIn` node is designed to initialize or update a pipeline configuration for image generation processes. It focuses on setting up or modifying the pipeline's parameters such as model, positive and negative conditioning, VAE, CLIP, image samples, and seed, ensuring that the pipeline is correctly configured for generating images based on specified conditions.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Represents the current state of the pipeline, including its configuration and any previously set parameters. It is essential for determining what needs to be initialized or updated within the pipeline. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model`: Specifies the model to be used in the pipeline, crucial for defining the generation process. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `pos`: Positive conditioning text to guide the image generation towards desired attributes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `neg`: Negative conditioning text to steer the image generation away from undesired attributes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent`: Represents the latent space vectors for the image generation, crucial for initializing or updating the pipeline's state. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `vae`: Specifies the Variational Autoencoder used in the pipeline, essential for encoding and decoding images. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `clip`: Specifies the CLIP model used for semantic understanding of images and texts, guiding the generation process. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `image`: The initial image or images to be processed or modified by the pipeline. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `xyPlot`: Optional parameter for specifying plot settings in the pipeline, used for visualizing attributes or results. Type should be `XYPLOT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The updated or newly created pipeline configuration, including settings for model, positive and negative conditioning, VAE, CLIP, image samples, and seed. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
