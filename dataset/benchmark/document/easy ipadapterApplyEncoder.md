- `easy ipadapterApplyEncoder`: The `easy ipadapterApplyEncoder` node is designed to encode images into positive and negative embeddings using an IPAdapter model. It processes multiple images, applying weights and masks to each, and combines the resulting embeddings according to a specified method. This node facilitates the integration of image features into models by generating embeddings that can be used to enhance or suppress certain aspects of the image in downstream tasks.
    - Inputs:
        - `model` (Required): The model parameter represents the base model to which the IPAdapter encoding process will be applied. It is crucial for ensuring that the encoding is compatible with the model's architecture and processing capabilities. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip_vision` (Required): The clip_vision parameter is essential for providing vision-related features or models that the IPAdapter might utilize during the encoding process. It enhances the encoding by incorporating visual context. Type should be `CLIP_VISION`.
        - `image1` (Required): The first image to be encoded by the IPAdapter, contributing to the generation of positive and negative embeddings. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `preset` (Required): Specifies the preset configuration for the IPAdapter encoding process, affecting how images are processed and encoded. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `num_embeds` (Required): The number of embeddings to generate, dictating how many images will be processed by the IPAdapter. Type should be `INT`.
        - `image2` (Optional): The second image to be encoded, if applicable, based on the num_embeds parameter. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image3` (Optional): The third image to be encoded, used when num_embeds is greater than two. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image4` (Optional): The fourth image to be encoded, used when num_embeds is four. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask1` (Optional): An optional mask for the first image, used to focus or exclude specific areas during encoding. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `weight1` (Optional): The weight applied to the first image's encoding, influencing the prominence of its features in the generated embeddings. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `mask2` (Optional): An optional mask for the second image, similar in purpose to mask1. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `weight2` (Optional): The weight applied to the second image's encoding. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `mask3` (Optional): An optional mask for the third image, following the same concept as the previous masks. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `weight3` (Optional): The weight applied to the third image's encoding. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `mask4` (Optional): An optional mask for the fourth image, used if num_embeds is four. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `weight4` (Optional): The weight applied to the fourth image's encoding. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `combine_method` (Optional): The method used to combine the generated embeddings, affecting the final output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `optional_ipadapter` (Optional): An optional IPAdapter parameter that can be used to modify the encoding process. Type should be `IPADAPTER`.
        - `pos_embeds` (Optional): Collects the positive embeddings generated by the IPAdapter for each image. These embeddings highlight features or aspects of the images that should be emphasized. Type should be `EMBEDS`.
        - `neg_embeds` (Optional): Collects the negative embeddings generated by the IPAdapter for each image. These embeddings represent features or aspects of the images that should be suppressed. Type should be `EMBEDS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: Returns the model after applying the IPAdapter encoding process, potentially modified with new embeddings. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip_vision`: Returns the clip_vision parameter, potentially modified or utilized during the encoding process. Type should be `CLIP_VISION`.
        - `ipadapter`: Returns the IPAdapter instance used for encoding, reflecting any changes or adjustments made during the process. Type should be `IPADAPTER`.
        - `pos_embed`: unknown Type should be `EMBEDS`.
        - `neg_embed`: unknown Type should be `EMBEDS`.
