- `easy dynamiCrafterLoader`: The `DynamiCrafterLoader` node is designed to facilitate the loading and initialization of models specific to the DynamiCrafter framework. It abstracts the complexities involved in setting up the necessary components for model operation, including loading pre-trained weights, configuring model parameters, and ensuring compatibility with various input and output formats. This node serves as a bridge between the DynamiCrafter's dynamic crafting capabilities and the user's requirements, streamlining the process of leveraging advanced generative models for creative and analytical purposes.
    - Parameters:
        - `model_name`: Specifies the name of the model to be loaded. This parameter is crucial as it determines which specific model configuration and weights are to be initialized, directly affecting the node's execution and the results produced. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clip_skip`: Indicates whether to skip the CLIP model loading, affecting how the input images are processed and interpreted by the system. Type should be `INT`.
        - `resolution`: Specifies the resolution for the output images, directly influencing the detail and quality of the generated content. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `empty_latent_width`: Defines the width of the empty latent space to be used for generation, impacting the dimensions of the generated content. Type should be `INT`.
        - `empty_latent_height`: Defines the height of the empty latent space to be used for generation, impacting the dimensions of the generated content. Type should be `INT`.
        - `positive`: A string input that specifies positive prompts or attributes to guide the model's generation process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `negative`: A string input that specifies negative prompts or attributes to influence the model's avoidance in the generation process. Type should be `STRING`.
