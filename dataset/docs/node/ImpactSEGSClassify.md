- `ImpactSEGSClassify`: The ImpactSEGSClassify node is designed to classify segments (SEGS) based on specified criteria, comparing attributes or labels within each segment to filter and categorize them accordingly. It supports complex conditional logic, allowing for dynamic segmentation based on the comparison results.
    - Parameters:
        - `preset_expr`: The 'preset_expr' input allows for the selection of predefined classification expressions or criteria. It influences the classification logic applied to the segments. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `manual_expr`: The 'manual_expr' input enables the specification of custom classification expressions or criteria. It allows for flexible and dynamic classification based on user-defined conditions. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `classifier`: The 'classifier' input specifies the classification model to be used for evaluating the segments. It is essential for determining the classification scores of each segment's attributes or labels. Type should be `TRANSFORMERS_CLASSIFIER`.
        - `segs`: The 'segs' input represents the segments to be classified and filtered. It is crucial for providing the data that will be processed and evaluated by the classifier. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `ref_image_opt`: The 'ref_image_opt' input optionally provides a reference image to enhance the classification process. It can affect the classification outcome by providing additional context. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `filtered_SEGS`: This output contains the segments that meet the classification criteria, effectively categorizing the input segments based on the specified conditions. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `remained_SEGS`: This output contains the segments that do not meet the classification criteria, allowing for further analysis or processing of unclassified segments. Type should be `SEGS`.
