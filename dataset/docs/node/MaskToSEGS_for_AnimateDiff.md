- `MaskToSEGS_for_AnimateDiff`: The MaskToSEGS_for_AnimateDiff node is designed to convert a mask into a segmented representation (SEGS) specifically tailored for animations with differences. It enhances the mask-to-SEGS conversion process by incorporating additional steps to handle the nuances of animated content, ensuring that the segmented output is optimized for subsequent processing in animation-focused workflows.
    - Parameters:
        - `combined`: The 'combined' parameter indicates whether the mask should be combined with other masks during the conversion process. This affects how the mask is processed and integrated into the segmented output. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `crop_factor`: The 'crop_factor' parameter determines the extent to which the input mask is cropped before conversion. This affects the granularity of the segmented output, allowing for finer control over the segmentation process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `bbox_fill`: The 'bbox_fill' parameter specifies whether bounding boxes should be filled during the segmentation process. This can influence the visual representation of the segmented output. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `drop_size`: The 'drop_size' parameter sets the minimum size of segments to be included in the output. Smaller segments below this threshold are dropped, allowing for a cleaner, more focused segmented representation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `contour_fill`: The 'contour_fill' parameter indicates whether contours within the mask should be filled during the segmentation process. This can enhance the visual clarity of the segmented output, especially in animations with distinct boundaries. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `mask`: The 'mask' parameter represents the input mask that is to be converted into segmented form. It plays a crucial role in defining the areas of interest within the animation frame. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `segs`: The output is a segmented representation (SEGS) of the input mask, optimized for animations with differences. It provides a detailed and structured format that is suitable for further processing in animation-focused workflows. Type should be `SEGS`.
