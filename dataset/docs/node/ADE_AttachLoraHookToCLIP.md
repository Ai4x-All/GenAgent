- `ADE_AttachLoraHookToCLIP`: This node is designed to attach a LoRA hook to a CLIP model, enhancing its functionality by integrating additional computational layers or modifications. It serves as a customization point for the CLIP model, allowing for tailored adjustments that can influence the model's behavior or outputs.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `clip`: The CLIP model to which the LoRA hook will be attached. This parameter is crucial as it determines the base model that will be modified. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `lora_hook`: The LoRA hook to be attached to the CLIP model. This hook represents the modifications or enhancements to be applied, playing a key role in customizing the model's functionality. Type should be `LORA_HOOK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `hook_CLIP`: The modified CLIP model with the LoRA hook attached, representing the enhanced version of the original model. Type should be `CLIP`.
