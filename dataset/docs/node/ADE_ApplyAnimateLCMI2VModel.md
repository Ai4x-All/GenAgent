- `ADE_ApplyAnimateLCMI2VModel`: This node is designed to apply the AnimateLCM-I2V model to animate images using latent code motion inference with I2V (Image-to-Video) capabilities. It integrates motion models and keyframe groups to generate dynamic, animated visuals from static images, enhancing them with motion and effects based on specified parameters.
    - Parameters:
        - `ref_drift`: Specifies the degree of drift or deviation from the original image's characteristics when applying motion, allowing for subtle or significant changes in the animated output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `apply_ref_when_disabled`: Determines whether the reference characteristics (e.g., drift) should be applied even when the motion model is disabled, ensuring continuity in the animation process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `start_percent`: Defines the starting point of the animation within the motion model's timeline, allowing for precise control over when the animation effects begin. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_percent`: Sets the endpoint of the animation within the motion model's timeline, enabling customization of the animation's duration and conclusion. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `motion_model`: The motion model parameter is crucial for defining the motion characteristics and dynamics that will be applied to the static image. It affects the node's execution by determining the type of animation and movement effects that will be introduced. Type should be `MOTION_MODEL_ADE`.
        - `ref_latent`: This parameter holds the reference latent representation of the image to be animated. It is essential for maintaining the image's original characteristics while applying motion effects. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `motion_lora`: A list of motion-specific LoRA settings that can be applied to further customize the animation effects and dynamics. Type should be `MOTION_LORA`.
        - `scale_multival`: Multipliers for scaling effects, providing additional control over the size and proportion of animated elements. Type should be `MULTIVAL`.
        - `effect_multival`: Multipliers for various effects, offering further customization of the visual appearance and dynamics of the animation. Type should be `MULTIVAL`.
        - `ad_keyframes`: Specifies a group of keyframes for advanced animation control, allowing for detailed customization of motion and effects over time. Type should be `AD_KEYFRAMES`.
        - `prev_m_models`: A group of previously applied motion models, enabling the node to build upon or modify existing animations for enhanced or varied effects. Type should be `M_MODELS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `m_models`: The updated list of motion models, including the most recently applied model with its configured animation and effects. Type should be `M_MODELS`.
