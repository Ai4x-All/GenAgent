        - `crop_left` (Required): The amount of cropping from the left side of the image, allowing for tailored image composition. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_right` (Required): The amount of cropping from the right side of the image, allowing for tailored image composition. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_top` (Required): The amount of cropping from the top of the image, allowing for tailored image composition. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_bottom` (Required): The amount of cropping from the bottom of the image, allowing for tailored image composition. Type should be `INT`.
        - `padding_left` (Required): The amount of padding added to the left side of the image, useful for framing or specific layout requirements. Type should be `INT`.
        - `padding_right` (Required): The amount of padding added to the right side of the image, useful for framing or specific layout requirements. Type should be `INT`.
