- `SeargeInput3`: SeargeInput3 is designed to process and integrate various input types for generating or modifying content, focusing on combining different forms of prompts and styles to tailor the output according to specific requirements or preferences.
    - Parameters:
        - `base_ratio`: Specifies the base ratio for high-resolution image processing, influencing the balance between base and refined details in the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `refiner_strength`: Determines the strength of the refinement process, affecting the intensity of details and textures in the final image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `refiner_intensity`: Controls the intensity of the refiner's effect, allowing for finer adjustments to how much the refiner alters the image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `precondition_steps`: Defines the number of steps to precondition the image, preparing it for further processing or refinement. Type should be `INT`.
        - `batch_size`: Sets the batch size for processing, impacting performance and the amount of data processed simultaneously. Type should be `INT`.
        - `upscale_resolution_factor`: Adjusts the factor by which the image resolution is increased, directly influencing the output image's clarity and detail. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `save_upscaled_image`: Determines whether the upscaled image is saved, providing control over the output management. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: Applies a denoising filter to the image, reducing noise and potentially improving visual quality. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `inputs`: Optional inputs for additional parameters or configurations, offering flexibility in the processing workflow. Type should be `PARAMETER_INPUTS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `inputs`: The processed inputs, potentially including modified or additional parameters for further stages of content generation or modification. Type should be `PARAMETER_INPUTS`.
