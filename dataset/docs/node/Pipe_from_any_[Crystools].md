- `Pipe from any [Crystools]`: This node is designed to facilitate the flow of data from a generic input to a specified output, allowing for the dynamic handling and transformation of various data types. It abstracts the complexity of data manipulation, providing a streamlined interface for data piping operations.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `CPipeAny`: This parameter represents a generic input that can be of any type. It is crucial for the node's operation as it serves as the source from which data is extracted and subsequently transformed or passed through. Type should be `CPipeAny`.
    - Outputs:
        - `CPipeAny`: This output represents the original input data, unaltered, serving as a pass-through for further processing. Type should be `CPipeAny`.
        - `any_1`: This output represents the first element of the input tuple, potentially transformed or directly passed through. Type should be `*`.
        - `any_2`: This output represents the second element of the input tuple, potentially transformed or directly passed through. Type should be `*`.
        - `any_3`: This output represents the third element of the input tuple, potentially transformed or directly passed through. Type should be `*`.
        - `any_4`: This output represents the fourth element of the input tuple, potentially transformed or directly passed through. Type should be `*`.
        - `any_5`: This output represents the fifth element of the input tuple, potentially transformed or directly passed through. Type should be `*`.
        - `any_6`: This output represents the sixth element of the input tuple, potentially transformed or directly passed through. Type should be `*`.
