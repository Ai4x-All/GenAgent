- `ADE_SigmaScheduleWeightedAverageInterp`: This node is designed to create a new sigma schedule by interpolating between two given sigma schedules based on a specified weight range and interpolation method. It effectively blends the characteristics of both input schedules into a single, new schedule, allowing for dynamic adjustments in the diffusion process.
    - Parameters:
        - `weight_A_Start`: The starting weight for the first sigma schedule in the interpolation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weight_A_End`: The ending weight for the first sigma schedule in the interpolation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `interpolation`: The method of interpolation to be used for blending the sigma schedules. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `schedule_A`: The first sigma schedule to be interpolated. Type should be `SIGMA_SCHEDULE`.
        - `schedule_B`: The second sigma schedule to be interpolated. Type should be `SIGMA_SCHEDULE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `sigma_schedule`: The resulting sigma schedule after interpolation. Type should be `SIGMA_SCHEDULE`.
