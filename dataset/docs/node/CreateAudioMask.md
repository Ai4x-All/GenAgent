- `CreateAudioMask`: The CreateAudioMask node is designed to generate visual masks from audio data. It utilizes the audio's spectrogram to create circular masks based on the amplitude of the audio frames, allowing for dynamic visual representations that correspond to audio intensity.
    - Parameters:
        - `invert`: A boolean flag that, when true, inverts the color of the masks, offering a visual contrast option. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `frames`: Specifies the number of frames to generate masks for, affecting the batch size and the number of output masks. Type should be `INT`.
        - `scale`: A scaling factor for the mask's size, allowing for adjustment of the visual representation's intensity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `audio_path`: The file path to the audio data used for generating masks, central to determining the audio's spectrogram. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `width`: Determines the width of the generated masks, directly influencing the dimensions of the output images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Sets the height of the generated masks, directly influencing the dimensions of the output images. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The generated visual masks as tensors, suitable for dynamic visual representations that correspond to audio intensity. Type should be `IMAGE`.
