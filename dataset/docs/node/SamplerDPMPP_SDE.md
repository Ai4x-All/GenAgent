- `SamplerDPMPP_SDE`: This node is designed to generate a sampler for the DPM++ SDE (Stochastic Differential Equation) model. It adapts to both CPU and GPU execution environments, optimizing the sampler's implementation based on the available hardware.
    - Parameters:
        - `eta`: Specifies the step size for the SDE solver, influencing the granularity of the sampling process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `s_noise`: Determines the level of noise to be applied during the sampling process, affecting the diversity of the generated samples. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `r`: Controls the ratio of noise reduction in the sampling process, impacting the clarity and quality of the generated samples. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `noise_device`: Selects the execution environment (CPU or GPU) for the sampler, optimizing performance based on available hardware. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `sampler`: The generated sampler configured with the specified parameters, ready for use in sampling operations. Type should be `SAMPLER`.
