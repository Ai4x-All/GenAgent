- `ToIntList`: The `ToIntList` node is designed to aggregate multiple integer inputs into a single list. This functionality is essential for scenarios where a collection of integers needs to be processed or manipulated as a single entity, streamlining operations that involve multiple integer values.
    - Parameters:
        - `inputs_len`: Specifies the number of integer inputs to be aggregated into the list. This parameter determines the size of the resulting list and plays a crucial role in the node's operation by dictating how many integer values will be considered. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `int`: The output is a list composed of the integer inputs provided to the node. This list serves as a consolidated collection of the individual integers, facilitating operations that require handling multiple integers as a unified structure. Type should be `INT`.
