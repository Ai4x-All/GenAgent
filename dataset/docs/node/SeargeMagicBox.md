- `SeargeMagicBox`: SeargeMagicBox orchestrates a complex pipeline for image generation and manipulation, leveraging a series of specialized processing stages. It dynamically selects and executes various stages such as data preprocessing, checkpoint loading, image styling, and resolution enhancement, facilitating a customizable and modular approach to generating high-quality images.
    - Parameters:
        - `stage`: Specifies the current processing stage to be executed, determining the specific operation or transformation to be applied to the image data. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `input_from`: Indicates the source of input for the current stage, potentially allowing for custom input alongside standard pipeline data. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `output_to`: Specifies the destination for the stage's output, enabling custom handling or integration into the standard data stream. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `data`: The data object that carries the image and related information through the processing pipeline, serving as the input and output medium for each stage. Type should be `SRG_DATA_STREAM`.
        - `custom_input`: Provides a mechanism for supplying custom input data to a stage, enabling specialized processing beyond the standard pipeline content. Type should be `SRG_STAGE_INPUT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `data`: The updated data object, reflecting the modifications and additions made by the current processing stage. Type should be `SRG_DATA_STREAM`.
        - `custom_output`: Custom output generated by the current stage, available for use in subsequent stages or for external processing. Type should be `SRG_STAGE_OUTPUT`.
