- `Image High Pass Filter`: This node applies a high-pass filter to an image, enhancing edges and details by subtracting a blurred version of the image from the original. It supports adjustments for the filter's radius and strength, and offers options for color output and a neutral background.
    - Parameters:
        - `radius`: Determines the radius of the Gaussian blur applied to create the high-pass filter, affecting the level of detail enhancement. Type should be `INT`.
        - `strength`: Adjusts the intensity of the high-pass filter effect, controlling how much the edges and details are emphasized. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `color_output`: Specifies whether the output image should be in color or grayscale. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `neutral_background`: Determines if a neutral background should be applied to the image, potentially enhancing visibility of details. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The input images to be processed with the high-pass filter. The filter enhances edges and details by emphasizing high-frequency components. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `images`: The resulting images after applying the high-pass filter, with enhanced edges and details. Type should be `IMAGE`.
