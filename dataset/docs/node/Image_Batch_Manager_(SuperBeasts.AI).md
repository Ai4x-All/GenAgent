- `Image Batch Manager (SuperBeasts.AI)`: The Image Batch Manager node is designed to reorder and process a batch of images based on specified dimensions and an optional new order. It enables the dynamic resizing and cropping of images to fit desired dimensions, and optionally reorders them according to a custom sequence, facilitating versatile image batch manipulation for various applications.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: Specifies the desired width for the output images, affecting the resizing and cropping operation to ensure images meet this width requirement. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Specifies the desired height for the output images, affecting the resizing and cropping operation to ensure images meet this height requirement. Type should be `INT`.
        - `ordering_enabled`: Determines whether the reordering functionality is enabled, allowing images to be rearranged according to the 'new_order' parameter if specified. This parameter enables or disables the ability to customize the sequence of the image batch. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `new_order`: Defines a custom sequence for reordering the images when 'ordering_enabled' is set to 'enabled', influencing the final arrangement of the image batch. This parameter should be a comma-separated list of indices representing the new order of images. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image1`: Represents one of up to twelve possible images to be included in the batch processing, contributing to the dynamic resizing, cropping, and optional reordering. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image2`: Represents one of up to twelve possible images to be included in the batch processing, contributing to the dynamic resizing, cropping, and optional reordering. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image3`: Represents one of up to twelve possible images to be included in the batch processing, contributing to the dynamic resizing, cropping, and optional reordering. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image4`: Represents one of up to twelve possible images to be included in the batch processing, contributing to the dynamic resizing, cropping, and optional reordering. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image5`: Represents one of up to twelve possible images to be included in the batch processing, contributing to the dynamic resizing, cropping, and optional reordering. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image6`: Represents one of up to twelve possible images to be included in the batch processing, contributing to the dynamic resizing, cropping, and optional reordering. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image7`: Represents one of up to twelve possible images to be included in the batch processing, contributing to the dynamic resizing, cropping, and optional reordering. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image8`: Represents one of up to twelve possible images to be included in the batch processing, contributing to the dynamic resizing, cropping, and optional reordering. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image9`: Represents one of up to twelve possible images to be included in the batch processing, contributing to the dynamic resizing, cropping, and optional reordering. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image10`: Represents one of up to twelve possible images to be included in the batch processing, contributing to the dynamic resizing, cropping, and optional reordering. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image11`: Represents one of up to twelve possible images to be included in the batch processing, contributing to the dynamic resizing, cropping, and optional reordering. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `image12`: Represents one of up to twelve possible images to be included in the batch processing, contributing to the dynamic resizing, cropping, and optional reordering. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The processed batch of images, resized, cropped, and optionally reordered according to the specified parameters. Type should be `IMAGE`.
