- `SegmDetectorSEGS`: This node is designed to process images through segmentation models to detect and segment objects within the images. It applies various operations such as thresholding and dilation to refine the segmentation masks, and optionally crops the images based on the detected segments. The node aims to facilitate detailed object analysis within images by providing segmented regions along with their corresponding metadata.
    - Inputs:
        - `segm_detector` (Required): Specifies the segmentation detector to be used for detecting and segmenting objects within the image. It is crucial for defining the detection capabilities and accuracy of the node. Type should be `SEGM_DETECTOR`.
        - `image` (Required): The input image to be processed. This image is analyzed by the segmentation model to identify and segment objects. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `threshold` (Required): A threshold value used to determine the sensitivity of object detection. Higher values result in fewer detections with higher confidence. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `dilation` (Required): An integer value specifying the amount of dilation to apply to the segmentation masks, enhancing the visibility and separation of detected objects. Type should be `INT`.
        - `crop_factor` (Required): Determines the extent to which the image is cropped around the detected segments, allowing for focused analysis on specific objects. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `drop_size` (Required): Specifies the minimum size for detected objects to be considered valid. Objects smaller than this size are dropped from the results. Type should be `INT`.
        - `labels` (Required): A list of labels to filter the detected segments. Only segments with matching labels are included in the results. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `detailer_hook` (Optional): An optional hook for custom post-processing of the detected segments. It allows for further refinement of the segmentation results. Type should be `DETAILER_HOOK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `segs`: Provides detailed segmentation results, including the shape of the original image and a list of segmented objects with their respective masks, confidence levels, and bounding boxes. Type should be `SEGS`.
