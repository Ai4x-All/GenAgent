- `SaltAdvancedAudioCompressor`: The SaltAdvancedAudioCompressor node is designed for advanced audio compression, allowing for detailed control over the compression process through parameters such as threshold, ratio, attack, release, and makeup gain. It utilizes ffmpeg to apply compression, offering a way to adjust the dynamics of audio content for various applications.
    - Parameters:
        - `threshold_dB`: The threshold level in decibels (dB) for the compressor. Signals above this level will be compressed, making it a key parameter for determining the loudness at which compression begins. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `ratio`: The compression ratio, indicating how much the audio signal is reduced once it exceeds the threshold. This parameter affects the intensity of the compression effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `attack_ms`: The attack time in milliseconds (ms), defining how quickly the compressor reacts to audio exceeding the threshold. Shorter attack times result in more immediate compression of transient sounds. Type should be `INT`.
        - `release_ms`: The release time in milliseconds (ms), specifying how quickly the compressor stops affecting the audio after it falls below the threshold. This parameter influences the smoothness of the audio's dynamic changes. Type should be `INT`.
        - `makeup_gain`: The makeup gain in decibels (dB), applied after compression to restore or increase the overall level of the audio signal. This allows for compensation of volume lost during compression. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `audio`: The raw audio data to be compressed. This input is crucial as it represents the audio content that will undergo compression, directly influencing the output quality and characteristics. Type should be `AUDIO`.
    - Outputs:
        - `audio`: The compressed audio data, resulting from the application of the specified compression settings. This output reflects the adjustments made to the audio's dynamics, suitable for further processing or playback. Type should be `AUDIO`.
