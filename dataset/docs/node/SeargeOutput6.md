- `SeargeOutput6`: SeargeOutput6 is designed to output HiResFix parameters, facilitating the adjustment and optimization of high-resolution image generation processes within the SeargeSDXL framework.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `parameters`: This parameter contains HiResFix settings and configurations, playing a crucial role in determining the behavior of high-resolution image enhancements. Type should be `PARAMETERS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `parameters`: Returns the HiResFix parameters, enabling fine-tuning of high-resolution image processing. Type should be `PARAMETERS`.
        - `hrf_steps`: Specifies the number of steps for the HiResFix process, impacting the detail level of the output image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `hrf_denoise`: Controls the denoising level applied during the HiResFix process, affecting image clarity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `hrf_upscale_factor`: Determines the upscaling factor, influencing the final image size in the HiResFix process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `hrf_noise_offset`: Adjusts the noise offset, modifying the texture and noise characteristics of the output image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `hrf_seed`: The seed value for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the HiResFix process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `hires_fix`: Indicates whether the high-resolution fix is enabled, toggling the application of HiResFix enhancements. Type should be `ENABLE_STATE`.
        - `hrf_smoothness`: Sets the smoothness level, affecting the softness or sharpness of the final image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
