- `SDXL Resolutions (JPS)`: This node is designed to calculate and return the width and height dimensions based on a predefined set of resolutions. It supports various aspect ratios and resolutions, facilitating the selection of appropriate dimensions for different image orientations and sizes.
    - Inputs:
        - `resolution` (Required): Specifies the desired resolution from a predefined list, influencing the output dimensions of width and height. This selection determines the aspect ratio and size of the resulting image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Outputs:
        - `width`: The calculated width dimension based on the selected resolution. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The calculated height dimension based on the selected resolution. Type should be `INT`.
