- `Evaluate Strings`: The `Evaluate Strings` node is designed to dynamically evaluate Python expressions using string variables. It allows for the execution of simple arithmetic or functional expressions by substituting string values for variables within the expression. This node is particularly useful for generating or manipulating string data based on dynamic inputs.
    - Parameters:
        - `python_expression`: Specifies the Python expression to be evaluated. This expression can include arithmetic operations or functions, with variables that will be replaced by their corresponding string values provided in other inputs. The choice of expression directly influences the node's behavior and output, as it determines the operations performed on the input strings. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `print_to_console`: Controls whether the evaluation result and variable values are printed to the console. This option is crucial for debugging or when visual confirmation of the process is needed, as it affects how the results are presented to the user. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `a`: Represents the string value to substitute for variable 'a' in the Python expression. Altering this value changes the outcome of the expression, demonstrating its direct impact on the node's execution and results. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `b`: Represents the string value to substitute for variable 'b' in the Python expression. This input plays a key role in the evaluation process by affecting the final result, based on how the expression utilizes this variable. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `c`: Represents the string value to substitute for variable 'c' in the Python expression. The value of 'c' significantly influences the evaluation outcome, showcasing its importance in the node's overall functionality. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `string`: The result of the evaluated Python expression, converted to a string. This output reflects the culmination of the node's processing, providing a string representation of the evaluation. Type should be `STRING`.
