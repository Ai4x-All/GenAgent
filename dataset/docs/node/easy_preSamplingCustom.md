        - `cfg`: Controls the conditioning factor, influencing the strength of the condition applied during sampling, with a default value and range provided. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `cfg_negative`: Specifies the negative conditioning factor, adjusting the influence of negative conditions during sampling. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Selects the specific sampler to be used during the pre-sampling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Chooses the scheduler for controlling the sampling steps, affecting the progression of the sampling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `steps`: Defines the number of steps to be taken during the sampling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `sigma_max`: Sets the maximum value of sigma for noise adjustment in the sampling process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sigma_min`: Determines the minimum value of sigma, setting the lower bound for noise adjustment. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `rho`: Adjusts the rho parameter, influencing the sampling dynamics. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `beta_d`: Controls the beta_d parameter, affecting the diffusion process during sampling. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `beta_min`: Sets the minimum value of beta, influencing the lower bound of the diffusion process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `eps_s`: Specifies the eps_s parameter, adjusting the step size in the sampling process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `flip_sigmas`: Enables or disables the flipping of sigma values, altering the noise pattern during sampling. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `denoise`: Adjusts the denoising factor, affecting the clarity and quality of the generated images. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `add_noise`: Enables or disables the addition of noise, influencing the texture and details of the generated images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed`: Sets the seed for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the sampling process. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Specifies the pipeline configuration, including model, positive and negative prompts, and other settings, serving as the foundation for the pre-sampling process. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `image_to_latent`: Converts an input image to a latent representation, integrating it into the pre-sampling process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `latent`: Provides a latent representation to be used directly in the pre-sampling process. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `optional_sampler`: Optionally specifies an alternative sampler for the pre-sampling process. Type should be `SAMPLER`.
        - `optional_sigmas`: Optionally provides a custom set of sigma values for noise adjustment. Type should be `SIGMAS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: Returns the modified pipeline configuration, now including custom pre-sampling settings, ready for further processing or image generation. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
