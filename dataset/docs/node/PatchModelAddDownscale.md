- `PatchModelAddDownscale`: The PatchModelAddDownscale node is designed to modify a given model by introducing downscaling and upscaling operations at specified points within the model's architecture. This process aims to adjust the model's internal representations by altering the resolution of feature maps, potentially enhancing the model's efficiency or performance on certain tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `block_number`: Specifies the block number within the model where the downscaling operation should be applied. This parameter allows for targeted modification of the model's architecture. Type should be `INT`.
        - `downscale_factor`: The factor by which the feature map's resolution is reduced during the downscaling operation. A higher downscale factor leads to a more significant reduction in resolution. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_percent`: Defines the starting point of the sigma range for applying the downscaling operation, based on the model's internal noise levels. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_percent`: Defines the ending point of the sigma range for applying the downscaling operation, allowing for precise control over when the operation is performed. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `downscale_after_skip`: A boolean flag indicating whether the downscaling operation should be applied after skip connections within the model. This choice can affect the flow of information through the model. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `downscale_method`: Specifies the method used for downscaling the feature maps. Different methods can affect the quality and characteristics of the downscaled representations. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `upscale_method`: Specifies the method used for upscaling the feature maps back to their original resolution. This parameter complements the downscale_method by restoring the feature map size. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model to be patched with downscaling and upscaling operations. This parameter is crucial as it defines the base model that will undergo modifications. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The modified model with downscaling and upscaling operations applied at specified points. This output reflects the adjustments made to the model's architecture. Type should be `MODEL`.
