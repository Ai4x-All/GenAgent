- `easy preSamplingNoiseIn`: This node is designed to inject noise into latent representations before sampling. It allows for the manipulation of latent space by adding noise, which can be controlled in terms of strength and distribution, to influence the generation process. This can be particularly useful in creative applications where variation and unpredictability are desired.
    - Parameters:
        - `factor`: A factor influencing the noise injection process, adjusting how the noise affects the latent space. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `steps`: The number of steps to apply in the noise injection process, determining the depth of manipulation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Configuration settings for the noise injection, providing additional control over the process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: The name of the sampler to use in conjunction with noise injection, affecting the sampling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: The scheduler settings for noise injection, coordinating the timing and sequence of operations. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: A parameter to control the denoising aspect of the process, affecting the clarity of the resulting latent space. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `seed`: The seed for random noise generation, ensuring reproducibility of the noise characteristics. Type should be `INT`.
        - `optional_noise_seed`: An optional seed parameter for more fine-grained control over the noise generation process. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: The pipeline configuration that includes the latent representations and possibly other settings for noise injection. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `optional_latent`: An optional direct input of latent representations, allowing for bypassing initial conversion steps. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The updated pipeline configuration after noise injection, including the manipulated latent representations. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
