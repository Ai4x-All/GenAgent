- `CSV Curve [Dream]`: The CSV Curve node is designed to interpret and apply animation curves based on data extracted from CSV files. It allows for the dynamic generation of animation parameters through the parsing of CSV file content, supporting interpolation and customization of the CSV parsing process.
    - Inputs:
        - `frame_counter` (Required): A counter tracking the current frame of the animation, essential for timing and synchronization of the animation curve with the overall animation sequence. Type should be `FRAME_COUNTER`.
        - `csvfile` (Required): Specifies the path to the CSV file to be used for generating the animation curve, enabling the node to dynamically interpret and apply the data contained within. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `first_column_type` (Required): Determines whether the first column of the CSV file represents seconds or frames, affecting how the data is interpreted in the context of animation timing. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `interpolate` (Required): Controls whether interpolation is applied between data points in the CSV file, allowing for smoother transitions in the generated animation curve. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `csv_dialect` (Required): Specifies the dialect of the CSV file, enabling the node to accurately parse files with different formatting conventions. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Outputs:
        - `FLOAT`: The floating-point value generated by the CSV Curve node, representing a point on the animation curve. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `INT`: An integer representation of the generated animation curve point, providing an alternative precision level. Type should be `INT`.
