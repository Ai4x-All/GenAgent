- `Switch string [Crystools]`: This node provides a mechanism to switch between two string values based on a boolean condition. It abstracts the conditional logic into a simple interface, allowing for cleaner and more readable code when dealing with binary decisions.
    - Parameters:
        - `on_true`: The string value to return if the boolean condition evaluates to True. It plays a crucial role in determining the output based on the condition. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `on_false`: The string value to return if the boolean condition evaluates to False. It serves as the alternative output, ensuring that a value is returned regardless of the condition's outcome. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `boolean`: The boolean condition that determines which of the two string values ('on_true' or 'on_false') is returned. It is the pivotal factor in the node's execution. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `string`: The output is one of the two input strings, selected based on the evaluation of the boolean condition. Type should be `STRING`.
