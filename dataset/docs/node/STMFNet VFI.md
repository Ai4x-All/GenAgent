- `STMFNet VFI`: STMFNet_VFI specializes in enhancing video sequences through frame interpolation, utilizing advanced neural network models to accurately predict and insert intermediate frames. This process aims to increase the frame rate of videos, resulting in smoother playback and improved visual quality.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: Specifies the checkpoint name for the model, determining the specific pre-trained weights to be used for frame interpolation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clear_cache_after_n_frames`: Controls the frequency of cache clearing to manage memory usage during the interpolation process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `multiplier`: Defines the factor by which the frame rate is to be increased, directly influencing the number of frames to be interpolated. Type should be `INT`.
        - `duplicate_first_last_frames`: A boolean flag indicating whether to duplicate the first and last frames, affecting the output video's length and smoothness. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `frames`: Represents the sequence of video frames to be interpolated. This input is crucial for determining the starting and ending points of interpolation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `optional_interpolation_states`: Allows for the specification of custom interpolation states, offering flexibility in handling frame skipping and other advanced interpolation scenarios. Type should be `INTERPOLATION_STATES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output consists of the interpolated video frames, enhancing the original sequence with additional frames to achieve smoother motion. Type should be `IMAGE`.
