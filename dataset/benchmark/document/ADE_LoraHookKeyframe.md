- `ADE_LoraHookKeyframe`: This node is designed to create a LoRA hook keyframe, which is a mechanism for adjusting the influence of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) hooks at specific points within an animation sequence. It allows for the dynamic scheduling of LoRA hooks' strength, enabling precise control over their effects throughout the animation process.
    - Inputs:
        - `strength_model` (Required): Specifies the strength of the LoRA hook at the keyframe, influencing how strongly the hook will affect the model's behavior at this point in the animation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_percent` (Required): Determines the starting point of the keyframe's effect as a percentage of the total animation length, allowing for the timing of the LoRA hook's influence to be precisely controlled. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `guarantee_steps` (Required): Guarantees a minimum number of steps for which the keyframe's effect will be applied, ensuring that the LoRA hook's influence is maintained for at least this duration. Type should be `INT`.
        - `prev_hook_kf` (Optional): An optional previous LoRA hook keyframe group to which the new keyframe will be added, enabling the chaining of multiple keyframes for complex animation effects. Type should be `LORA_HOOK_KEYFRAMES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `HOOK_KF`: Returns a group of LoRA hook keyframes, including the newly created keyframe, facilitating the management and application of multiple keyframes within an animation. Type should be `LORA_HOOK_KEYFRAMES`.
