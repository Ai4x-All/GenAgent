- `RegionalConditioningColorMask __Inspire`: The RegionalConditioningColorMask node in the Inspire Pack focuses on applying regional conditioning to an input CLIP representation based on a specified color mask. It allows for the targeted manipulation of image features by overlaying a color mask, adjusting its strength, and specifying the area of conditioning, thereby enabling more precise control over the generation process.
    - Parameters:
        - `mask_color`: The color value used to generate the mask from the color_mask image, defining the specific region for conditioning. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `strength`: Determines the intensity of the conditioning applied to the specified region, allowing for fine-tuning of the effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `set_cond_area`: Specifies the area of the image to be conditioned, either the default area or the bounds of the mask, providing flexibility in targeting. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `prompt`: The text prompt that guides the conditioning process, influencing the characteristics of the generated content within the masked region. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip`: The CLIP representation to which the regional conditioning is applied, serving as the basis for the targeted manipulation. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `color_mask`: An image mask that specifies the region to be conditioned, based on the provided color. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: The conditioned CLIP representation, modified according to the specified parameters and mask. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `mask`: The generated mask based on the specified color, used for conditioning. Type should be `MASK`.
