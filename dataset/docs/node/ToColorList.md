- `ToColorList`: The `ToColorList` node is designed to transform a collection of color-related data into a structured list format, specifically tailored for handling color information. This node facilitates the organization and manipulation of color data, making it easier to process and utilize in various computational color analysis and manipulation tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `inputs_len`: Represents the collection of color data to be transformed into a list. This parameter is crucial for the node's operation as it determines the content of the resulting color list, affecting subsequent processing and analysis. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `color`: The structured list of color data, organized for efficient processing and manipulation in further color-related computational tasks. Type should be `COLOR`.
