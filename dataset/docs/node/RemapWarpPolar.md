- `RemapWarpPolar`: The RemapWarpPolar node is designed to transform images by applying a warp polar effect, which can include adjustments for radius, center, and whether to apply the transformation in a logarithmic or linear fashion. It supports inverse transformations and optional cropping to the transformed area.
    - Parameters:
        - `max_radius`: Specifies the maximum radius for the warp polar transformation, affecting how far from the center the effect extends. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `radius_adjust`: Adjusts the effective radius of the transformation, scaling the maximum radius to fine-tune the effect's reach. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `center_x_adjust`: Adjusts the center point of the transformation along the x-axis, allowing for horizontal shifting of the effect's origin. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `center_y_adjust`: Adjusts the center point of the transformation along the y-axis, enabling vertical shifting of the effect's origin. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `log`: Determines whether the transformation should apply a logarithmic mapping, altering the visual effect of the warp. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `inverse`: When enabled, applies the inverse of the warp polar transformation, potentially reversing the effect. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `crop`: Enables cropping of the transformed image to the area affected by the warp, removing any excess. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `remap`: The node returns a transformed image and an optional mask, both potentially cropped, as a result of the warp polar effect. Type should be `REMAP`.
