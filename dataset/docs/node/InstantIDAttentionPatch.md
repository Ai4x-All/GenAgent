- `InstantIDAttentionPatch`: The InstantIDAttentionPatch node is designed to modify the attention mechanisms within a given model to enhance its capability to focus on specific features or areas of interest. This patching process aims to improve the model's performance by adjusting its attention layers according to custom specifications.
    - Parameters:
        - `weight`: The weight parameter influences the degree of attention modification, allowing for fine-tuning of the patch's impact. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_at`: Specifies the starting point within the model's layers for applying the attention patch, dictating the scope of modification. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_at`: Defines the endpoint within the model's layers for the attention patch application, marking the boundary of the patching process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `noise`: An optional parameter that introduces randomness into the patching process, potentially enhancing model robustness. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `instantid`: The model instance to which the attention patch will be applied, enhancing its focus capabilities. Type should be `INSTANTID`.
        - `insightface`: A pre-trained model used for face detection and feature extraction, providing critical input for the attention patching process. Type should be `FACEANALYSIS`.
        - `image`: The input image on which face detection and feature extraction are performed, serving as a basis for attention modification. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `model`: The specific model within which the attention mechanisms are to be patched, targeting its layers for enhancement. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `mask`: An optional mask that can be applied during the patching process to focus the attention modification on specific areas. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The modified model with enhanced attention mechanisms, reflecting the applied patches. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `face_embeds`: The extracted facial embeddings from the input image, used as part of the attention patching process. Type should be `FACE_EMBEDS`.
