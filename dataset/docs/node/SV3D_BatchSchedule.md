- `SV3D_BatchSchedule`: The SV3D_BatchSchedule node is designed for scheduling azimuth and elevation conditions for SV3D, a video model by Stability AI. It allows users to define how the camera's azimuth and elevation should change over time, enhancing the generation of 3D videos.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: The width of the generated video frames, allowing customization of the video's resolution. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The height of the generated video frames, enabling control over the video's aspect ratio and resolution. Type should be `INT`.
        - `batch_size`: Determines the number of video frames to generate in a single batch, impacting the generation speed and memory usage. Type should be `INT`.
        - `interpolation`: The method of interpolation between keyframes, affecting the smoothness of the transition in generated video frames. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `azimuth_points_string`: A string defining key points for azimuth changes over the video timeline, controlling the horizontal rotation of the camera. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `elevation_points_string`: A string specifying key points for elevation changes over the video timeline, managing the vertical angle of the camera. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip_vision`: Specifies the CLIP vision model to use, affecting how visual features are interpreted and processed. Type should be `CLIP_VISION`.
        - `init_image`: The initial image to start the video generation from, setting the visual context. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `vae`: Defines the VAE model used for encoding and decoding images, crucial for the video generation process. Type should be `VAE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `positive`: The positive conditioning output, influencing the generation towards desired features. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: The negative conditioning output, guiding the generation away from undesired features. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent`: The latent representation of the video, serving as a foundational element for video generation. Type should be `LATENT`.
