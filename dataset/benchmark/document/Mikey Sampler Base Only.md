- `Mikey Sampler Base Only`: The Mikey Sampler Base Only node is designed for basic sampling tasks within a specialized framework, focusing on generating outputs based on a simplified set of parameters. It abstracts the complexity of underlying sampling algorithms to provide a straightforward interface for generating samples.
    - Inputs:
        - `base_model` (Required): Specifies the base model used for sampling, serving as the foundation for generating outputs. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `samples` (Required): Represents the latent samples that are either inputted to or generated by the node, depending on the context. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `positive_cond_base` (Required): Defines the positive conditioning for the base model, guiding the generation towards desired outcomes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative_cond_base` (Required): Specifies the negative conditioning for the base model, aiming to steer the generation away from certain themes or elements. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `vae` (Required): The variational autoencoder used in conjunction with the base model to enhance the sampling process. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `model_name` (Required): The name of the model used for upsampling, providing a means to refine the generated samples. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed` (Required): A seed value for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the samples. Type should be `INT`.
        - `upscale_by` (Required): A factor by which the samples are upscaled, affecting the resolution and detail of the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `hires_strength` (Required): Determines the strength of high-resolution features in the upscaled samples, allowing for finer control over the output quality. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `smooth_step` (Required): An optional parameter that can smooth the transition between steps in the sampling process, potentially enhancing the output quality. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The output is a latent representation of the generated sample, encapsulating the complex features and characteristics derived from the input prompts. Type should be `LATENT`.
