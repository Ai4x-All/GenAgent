- `SaltConditioningSetMaskAndCombine`: The SaltConditioningSetMaskAndCombine node is designed for advanced conditioning manipulation in audio-visual scheduling tasks. It combines and applies masks to multiple conditioning schedules, allowing for precise control over the conditioning process with the option to adjust mask strengths and set conditioning areas based on mask bounds. This node is essential for tasks requiring detailed and dynamic conditioning adjustments in multimedia content generation.
    - Parameters:
        - `set_cond_area`: Determines whether the conditioning area is set to default or adjusted to mask bounds, affecting how masks are applied. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `positive_schedule_a`: Represents the first set of positive conditioning schedules to be combined and masked. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative_schedule_a`: Represents the first set of negative conditioning schedules to be combined and masked. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `positive_schedule_b`: Represents the second set of positive conditioning schedules to be combined and masked. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative_schedule_b`: Represents the second set of negative conditioning schedules to be combined and masked. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `mask_a`: The mask to be applied to the first set of conditioning schedules. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask_b`: The mask to be applied to the second set of conditioning schedules. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask_strengths_a`: A list of strengths for each mask applied to the first set of conditioning schedules, allowing for variable influence. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `mask_strengths_b`: A list of strengths for each mask applied to the second set of conditioning schedules, allowing for variable influence. Type should be `LIST`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: unknown Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
