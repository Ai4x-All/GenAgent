- `IPAdapterCombineWeights`: The IPAdapterCombineWeights node is designed to aggregate and combine weight values from two different sources, providing a unified set of weights and their count. This functionality is essential for operations that require the blending or merging of weight parameters from distinct inputs, facilitating more nuanced control over weight-based computations or adjustments.
    - Parameters:
        - `weights_i`: unknown Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `weights`: The combined list of weights resulting from merging weights_1 and weights_2, reflecting the aggregate influence of both inputs. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `count`: The total number of weights in the combined list, providing a quantitative measure of the outcome of the combination process. Type should be `INT`.
