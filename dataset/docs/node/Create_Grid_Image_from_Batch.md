- `Create Grid Image from Batch`: This node is designed to generate a grid image from a batch of images. It organizes multiple images into a grid layout based on specified parameters such as the number of columns, maximum cell size, and border properties. The node aims to facilitate the visualization of collections of images in a structured and aesthetically pleasing manner.
    - Parameters:
        - `border_width`: Specifies the width of the border around each image in the grid. This parameter adds a visual separation between images, enhancing the grid's clarity and aesthetics. Type should be `INT`.
        - `number_of_columns`: Indicates the number of columns in the grid. This parameter directly influences the layout of the grid image by specifying how many images are placed in each row. Type should be `INT`.
        - `max_cell_size`: Sets the maximum size for each cell in the grid. This parameter controls the scaling of images to fit within the specified cell dimensions, ensuring a uniform appearance. Type should be `INT`.
        - `border_red`: Determines the red component of the border color. This parameter, along with the green and blue components, allows for customization of the border color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `border_green`: Determines the green component of the border color. This parameter, along with the red and blue components, allows for customization of the border color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `border_blue`: Determines the blue component of the border color. This parameter, along with the red and green components, allows for customization of the border color. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: Specifies the directory path where the images are located. This path is essential for the node to locate and process the images for grid generation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: Produces a tensor representation of the generated grid image. This output facilitates further processing or visualization within the pipeline. Type should be `IMAGE`.
