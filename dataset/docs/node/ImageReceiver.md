- `ImageReceiver`: The ImageReceiver node is designed to process and transform image data received in various formats, including base64-encoded strings. It decodes, transposes, and converts images to a standardized format for further processing or analysis, optionally applying a mask if transparency data is available. This node plays a crucial role in preparing image data for downstream tasks by ensuring images are in a consistent and usable state.
    - Parameters:
        - `image`: The 'image' parameter represents the image to be processed. It is crucial for the node's operation as it serves as the primary input upon which all transformations and analyses are performed. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `link_id`: The 'link_id' parameter is used to identify the specific processing task or workflow instance. It helps in tracking and managing the processed images within a larger system or application. Type should be `INT`.
        - `save_to_workflow`: This boolean parameter determines whether the processed image should be saved to the workflow. Enabling this option triggers the image processing and transformation steps. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `image_data`: The 'image_data' parameter contains the image information, typically as a base64-encoded string. It is essential for decoding and converting the image into a format suitable for further processing. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `trigger_always`: This parameter controls whether the node's processing should be triggered unconditionally. It allows for flexibility in workflow execution, ensuring that image processing can occur as needed. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The processed image, transformed and standardized for further use. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: An optional mask generated based on the image's transparency data, useful for selective processing or analysis. Type should be `MASK`.
