- `LoadImageListFromDir __Inspire`: This node is designed to load a list of images from a specified directory, facilitating batch processing or analysis of multiple images at once. It abstracts the complexities of reading and processing image files from the filesystem, making it easier to integrate image data into workflows.
    - Parameters:
        - `directory`: Specifies the directory path from which images will be loaded. This parameter is crucial for determining the source of the images to be processed. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `image_load_cap`: Limits the number of images to be loaded from the directory, allowing for control over resource usage and processing time. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_index`: Determines the starting index for loading images, enabling selective reading of images from a larger set. Type should be `INT`.
        - `load_always`: A flag that, when set, forces the node to load images regardless of other conditions that might normally prevent loading. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: A list of loaded images, processed and ready for further use in the workflow. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: A list of masks corresponding to the loaded images, useful for operations requiring image segmentation or modification. Type should be `MASK`.
