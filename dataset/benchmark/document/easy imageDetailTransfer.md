- `easy imageDetailTransfer`: This node specializes in transferring intricate details from a source image to a target image, enhancing the target with characteristics or styles found in the source. It operates by blending visual elements between images, potentially using various modes of blending to achieve the desired effect. The node is designed for applications requiring high fidelity in detail preservation or stylistic amalgamation, making it suitable for tasks like photo editing, artistic creation, and visual content enhancement.
    - Inputs:
        - `target` (Required): The 'target' parameter represents the image that will receive the details or styles from the source image. It plays a crucial role in the operation by serving as the canvas on which the transferred details are applied, directly influencing the outcome of the detail transfer process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `source` (Required): The 'source' parameter specifies the image from which details or styles will be extracted and transferred to the target image. Its content significantly affects the detail transfer process, as it provides the visual elements to be blended into the target. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mode` (Required): The 'mode' parameter determines the blending technique used to transfer details from the source to the target image. It influences the visual outcome of the transfer, offering various options for how the details are integrated. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `blur_sigma` (Required): Specifies the standard deviation for the Gaussian blur applied to the target image, affecting the smoothness of the detail transfer. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `blend_factor` (Required): Controls the intensity of the blending between the source and target images, directly influencing the visibility of transferred details. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `image_output` (Required): Determines how the output image is handled, whether it is hidden, previewed, saved, or a combination of these actions. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `save_prefix` (Required): A prefix added to the filename when saving the output image, helping in organizing and identifying the results. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `mask` (Optional): An optional mask that can be applied to the target image, specifying areas where the detail transfer should or should not occur. This parameter allows for more precise control over the application of transferred details, enabling selective enhancement based on the mask's coverage. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The final image after the detail transfer process, incorporating the blended details from the source image into the target. Type should be `IMAGE`.
