- `ApplyInstantID`: The ApplyInstantID node is designed to integrate InstantID technology into images, leveraging facial analysis and control networks to enhance or modify the image based on specified conditions. It utilizes advanced image processing and machine learning techniques to apply identity-related modifications or enhancements, ensuring high precision and customization in the output.
    - Parameters:
        - `weight`: Overall weight factor influencing the strength of InstantID application, allowing for adjustment of the modification intensity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_at`: Defines the starting point of the application process, allowing for phased or gradual application of InstantID. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_at`: Specifies the endpoint of the application process, enabling precise control over the extent of InstantID modifications. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `instantid`: Represents the InstantID model to be applied, crucial for the identity processing and enhancement operations. Type should be `INSTANTID`.
        - `insightface`: Facial analysis model used for detecting and analyzing faces within the image, essential for accurate application of InstantID. Type should be `FACEANALYSIS`.
        - `control_net`: Control network model that guides the application of InstantID, ensuring the modifications adhere to specified conditions. Type should be `CONTROL_NET`.
        - `image`: The input image to which InstantID will be applied, serving as the base for identity-related enhancements. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `model`: The specific model configuration used for InstantID application, dictating the processing and enhancement techniques. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `positive`: Positive conditioning text guiding the InstantID application towards desired identity attributes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Negative conditioning text that specifies undesired identity attributes to avoid during InstantID application. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `image_kps`: Optional keypoints image, used for more detailed and accurate facial analysis and InstantID application. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: Optional mask to be applied during the InstantID process, allowing for selective application of modifications. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `MODEL`: The modified model after applying InstantID, reflecting the integration of identity-related enhancements. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `positive`: The positive conditioning text after processing, potentially adjusted to better align with the applied InstantID modifications. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: The negative conditioning text post-processing, potentially refined to exclude undesired identity attributes more effectively. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
