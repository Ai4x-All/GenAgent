- `SamplerCustomAdvanced`: The SamplerCustomAdvanced node is designed to provide advanced custom sampling functionalities within a generative modeling framework. It enables the creation and utilization of custom samplers, offering a flexible approach to sampling strategies that can be tailored to specific needs or experimental setups.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `noise`: Specifies the type of noise to be added to the latent image, affecting the variability and characteristics of the generated samples. Type should be `NOISE`.
        - `guider`: Defines the guiding mechanism for the sampling process, influencing the direction and quality of the generated outputs based on specified conditions. Type should be `GUIDER`.
        - `sampler`: Determines the sampling strategy to be used, impacting the exploration of the latent space and the diversity of the generated samples. Type should be `SAMPLER`.
        - `sigmas`: Sets the scale of noise to be applied, playing a crucial role in the denoising process and the final quality of the generated images. Type should be `SIGMAS`.
        - `latent_image`: The initial latent representation to be transformed, serving as the starting point for the sampling process. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `output`: The modified latent representation after the sampling process. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `denoised_output`: The denoised version of the latent representation, offering a cleaner version of the sampled output. Type should be `LATENT`.
