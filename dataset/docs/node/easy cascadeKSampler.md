- `easy cascadeKSampler`: The `easy cascadeKSampler` node facilitates the application of a cascading sampling process, simplifying the integration and execution of multiple sampling stages within a single workflow. This node is designed to streamline complex sampling operations, making it easier for users to apply advanced sampling techniques with minimal configuration.
    - Parameters:
        - `image_output`: Determines the output format for the images generated by the sampling process, including options for hiding, previewing, saving, or a combination of these actions. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `link_id`: A unique identifier used to link the output of the sampling process with other processes or storage locations. Type should be `INT`.
        - `save_prefix`: A prefix added to the filenames of saved images, allowing for organized storage and easy retrieval. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Specifies the pipeline configuration for the cascading sampling process, indicating the sequence of operations and transformations to be applied. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model_c`: An optional parameter allowing the specification of a custom model configuration for the sampling process, providing flexibility in choosing different generative models. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: Outputs the modified pipeline configuration after the cascading sampling process, reflecting the applied transformations and operations. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `image`: Provides the images resulting from the cascading sampling process, which can be used for further processing or analysis. Type should be `IMAGE`.
