- `SaltAudioNoiseReductionSpectralSubtraction`: This node applies spectral subtraction-based noise reduction to audio inputs, effectively reducing background noise and enhancing audio clarity.
    - Parameters:
        - `noise_floor`: A parameter controlling the threshold for noise reduction, influencing the extent to which noise is removed from the audio. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `audio`: The raw audio data to be processed for noise reduction. Type should be `AUDIO`.
    - Outputs:
        - `audio`: The processed audio data with reduced noise. Type should be `AUDIO`.
