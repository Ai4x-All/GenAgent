- `ImageContainerInheritanceAdd`: This node is designed to perform an additive operation on a collection of images, adjusting their dimensions and applying color transformations based on specified parameters. It encapsulates the functionality to scale and modify images in a batch, leveraging inheritance to extend or customize the image processing workflow.
    - Parameters:
        - `add_width`: The additional width to be added to the images, affecting the overall size. Type should be `INT`.
        - `add_height`: The additional height to be added to the images, affecting the overall size. Type should be `INT`.
        - `red`: The red color component to be added to each image, influencing the final color balance. Type should be `INT`.
        - `green`: The green color component to be added to each image, influencing the final color balance. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blue`: The blue color component to be added to each image, influencing the final color balance. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha`: The alpha (transparency) value to be applied to each image, affecting its opacity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `method`: Specifies the method to be used for the additive operation, potentially altering how colors and dimensions are adjusted. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The collection of images to be processed. It serves as the primary input for the node, determining the base content for subsequent operations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is an image or a collection of images that have been processed according to the specified parameters, including dimension adjustments and color transformations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
