- `easy comfyLoader`: The `easy comfyLoader` node is designed to simplify the process of loading and configuring models for image generation tasks. It abstracts the complexities involved in setting up models, including checkpoint selection and resolution adjustments, making it easier for users to initiate and customize their image generation workflows.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: Specifies the checkpoint name for the model to be loaded, playing a crucial role in determining the model's behavior and output quality. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `vae_name`: Selects the VAE model to be used, impacting the style and characteristics of the generated images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clip_skip`: Determines the number of CLIP model layers to skip, adjusting the influence of CLIP on the generation process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `lora_name`: Specifies the LoRA model to be used, allowing for fine-tuned control over the generation process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lora_model_strength`: Sets the strength of the LoRA model adjustments, modifying the impact on the generated images. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `lora_clip_strength`: Defines the strength of CLIP adjustments when using a LoRA model, influencing the final image output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `resolution`: Defines the resolution for the generated images, allowing users to customize the output size according to their requirements. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `empty_latent_width`: Specifies the width of the empty latent space, affecting the dimensions of the generated images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `empty_latent_height`: Specifies the height of the empty latent space, impacting the dimensions of the generated images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `positive`: A positive prompt that guides the image generation towards desired themes or concepts, influencing the creative direction of the output. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `negative`: A negative prompt used to steer the image generation away from certain themes or concepts, refining the output by excluding undesired elements. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `batch_size`: Determines the number of images to be generated in a single batch, affecting the efficiency and speed of the image generation process. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `optional_lora_stack`: Optionally includes a Lora stack configuration to further customize the model's behavior, offering advanced control over the generation process. Type should be `LORA_STACK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: Provides the pipeline configuration for image generation, integrating various models and settings. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model`: Returns the main model used in the generation process, configured according to the specified parameters. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `vae`: Returns the VAE model used, reflecting the chosen settings for style and characteristics of the generated images. Type should be `VAE`.
