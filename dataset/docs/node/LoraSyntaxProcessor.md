- `LoraSyntaxProcessor`: The LoraSyntaxProcessor node is designed to interpret and process specific syntax within text inputs to dynamically modify machine learning models and their parameters. It focuses on parsing 'lora' syntax to apply corresponding adjustments to models and clips, facilitating the customization of model behavior based on textual prompts.
    - Parameters:
        - `text`: The text input containing 'lora' syntax that specifies how the model and clip should be adjusted. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `seed`: A seed value used for processing random syntax within the text input, ensuring reproducibility. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The machine learning model to be adjusted based on the 'lora' syntax within the text input. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: A clip parameter that may be modified alongside the model as part of the 'lora' syntax processing. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The adjusted machine learning model after processing the 'lora' syntax. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip`: The modified clip parameter after 'lora' syntax processing. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `text`: The original text input before any processing, for reference or further use. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `unprocessed_text`: The original text input with 'lora' syntax removed, indicating the adjustments have been applied. Type should be `STRING`.
