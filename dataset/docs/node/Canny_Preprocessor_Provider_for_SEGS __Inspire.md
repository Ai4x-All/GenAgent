- `Canny_Preprocessor_Provider_for_SEGS __Inspire`: This node provides a Canny edge detection preprocessor for SEGS (Semantic Edge Guided Synthesis), aimed at enhancing image edges for better segmentation and synthesis outcomes.
    - Parameters:
        - `low_threshold`: Specifies the lower bound for the hysteresis thresholding step in the Canny edge detection algorithm, influencing the detection of weaker edges. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `high_threshold`: Defines the upper bound for the hysteresis thresholding step, determining the detection of the most pronounced edges. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `segs_preprocessor`: Outputs a preprocessor object configured for Canny edge detection, ready to be used in SEGS workflows. Type should be `SEGS_PREPROCESSOR`.
