- `Cross Fade Image Batches (SuperBeasts.AI)`: The Cross Fade Image Batches (SuperBeasts.AI) node is designed to blend two sequences of images (batches) together over a specified number of frames, using a cross-fading effect. This node allows for the creation of smooth transitions between image sequences by interpolating the pixel values of the images at the end of the first batch and the beginning of the second batch, according to a specified easing function and fade strength.
    - Parameters:
        - `fade_frames`: The number of frames over which the cross-fade effect should occur. This determines the length of the transition. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fade_strength`: The strength of the fade effect, controlling how much the images from the two batches blend together. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `ease_type`: The type of easing function to use for the fade effect, such as linear, ease_in, ease_out, or ease_in_out, which affects the transition's smoothness. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `batch1`: The first batch of images to be cross-faded. It represents the starting sequence of the transition. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `batch2`: The second batch of images to be cross-faded. It represents the ending sequence of the transition. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting batch of images after applying the cross-fade effect, combining non-faded, faded, and remaining frames. Type should be `IMAGE`.
