- `StableCascade_CheckpointLoader __Inspire`: This node is designed to efficiently manage and load model checkpoints in a cascading manner, optimizing the process by utilizing caching mechanisms to avoid redundant loads. It supports conditional loading based on cache availability and specific requirements, thereby enhancing performance and resource utilization in model deployment scenarios.
    - Parameters:
        - `stage_b`: Specifies the checkpoint for the 'b' stage model. This parameter is essential for identifying and loading the correct model, with an option to utilize caching for improved efficiency. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `key_opt_b`: An optional key for the 'b' stage checkpoint to uniquely identify it in the cache, allowing for precise cache management and retrieval. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `stage_c`: Specifies the checkpoint for the 'c' stage model. Similar to 'stage_b', it is crucial for loading the appropriate model and can leverage caching for optimization. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `key_opt_c`: Serves as an optional key for the 'c' stage checkpoint, enabling specific cache operations and ensuring efficient model management. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `cache_mode`: Determines the caching strategy (e.g., none, stage_b, stage_c, all), affecting how checkpoints are stored or retrieved from the cache to optimize loading times. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `b_model`: The model loaded from the 'b' stage checkpoint, ready for use. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `b_vae`: The VAE component associated with the 'b' stage model. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `c_model`: The model loaded from the 'c' stage checkpoint, ready for use. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `c_vae`: The VAE component associated with the 'c' stage model. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `c_clip_vision`: The CLIP vision component loaded alongside the 'c' stage model, facilitating multimodal operations. Type should be `CLIP_VISION`.
        - `clip`: The CLIP model component, supporting various tasks including text and image understanding. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `key_b`: The cache key associated with the 'b' stage model, reflecting its cache status or identifier. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `key_c`: The cache key associated with the 'c' stage model, reflecting its cache status or identifier. Type should be `STRING`.
