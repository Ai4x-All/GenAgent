- `LLMMultiModalImageEvaluation`: This node is designed to evaluate images based on a given query using a specified LLM model. It processes image paths or documents, loads the images, and sends them to the LLM model along with the query for evaluation, providing a text-based assessment of the images.
    - Inputs:
        - `llm_model` (Required): The LLM model used for evaluating the images. It is crucial for performing the evaluation as it processes the images and the query to generate the evaluation result. Type should be `LLM_MODEL`.
        - `image_documents` (Required): A list of image documents to be evaluated. These documents are processed and evaluated by the LLM model in conjunction with the query. Type should be `DOCUMENT`.
        - `llm_message` (Required): The query or message to be evaluated by the LLM model. This message guides the evaluation process of the images. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `max_tokens` (Optional): The maximum number of tokens to be generated by the LLM model during the evaluation. It limits the length of the evaluation result. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `response`: The evaluation result text from the LLM model, providing a text-based assessment of the images. Type should be `STRING`.
