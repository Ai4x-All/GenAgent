- `Text Parse Tokens`: The node is designed to parse and replace tokens within a given text. It utilizes a custom token parsing mechanism to identify and substitute predefined tokens with their corresponding values, facilitating dynamic text manipulation.
    - Inputs:
        - `text` (Required): The input text to be parsed for tokens. This parameter is crucial as it provides the content within which tokens are to be identified and replaced, directly influencing the node's output. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `string`: The output is the text after token parsing and replacement. This reflects the transformed text with all predefined tokens substituted with their corresponding values. Type should be `STRING`.
