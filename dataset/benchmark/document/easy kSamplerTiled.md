- `easy kSamplerTiled`: The 'easy kSamplerTiled' node is designed to facilitate the generation of images in a tiled manner, leveraging a simplified interface for the kSampler process. This node abstracts the complexities involved in tiled image generation, making it accessible for users to create high-quality, tiled images efficiently.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe` (Required): This input type represents the pipeline configuration for image generation, specifying the sequence of operations and models to be used. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `tile_size` (Required): Specifies the dimensions for each tile in the generated image, influencing the granularity of the tiling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `image_output` (Required): Determines the format and characteristics of the output image, including resolution and file type. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `link_id` (Required): A unique identifier for linking generated tiles to specific requests or sessions, facilitating tracking and organization. Type should be `INT`.
        - `save_prefix` (Required): A prefix added to the filenames of saved images, allowing for customized naming conventions. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `model` (Optional): Defines the model used for image generation, impacting the style and quality of the output. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: Returns the updated pipeline configuration after the tiling process, reflecting any changes or adjustments made. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `image`: The final tiled image generated by the node, ready for use or further processing. Type should be `IMAGE`.
