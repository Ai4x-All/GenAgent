- `GenerateNoise`: The GenerateNoise node is designed to create synthetic noise data. It can generate noise patterns based on specified dimensions, seed, and scaling factors, and offers options for normalization and producing constant noise across a batch. This functionality is essential for tasks that require noise injection into latent spaces or for use as a base in generative models, where the noise acts as a seed for further transformations.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: Determines the width of the generated noise pattern, affecting the spatial dimensions of the output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Sets the height of the generated noise pattern, influencing the spatial dimensions of the noise output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `batch_size`: Specifies the number of noise samples to generate, allowing for batch processing of noise generation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `seed`: A seed value for the random number generator, ensuring reproducibility of the noise patterns. Type should be `INT`.
        - `multiplier`: A scaling factor applied to the noise, adjusting its intensity or amplitude. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `constant_batch_noise`: A boolean flag that, when true, makes the entire batch use the same noise pattern, enhancing consistency across generated samples. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `normalize`: When enabled, normalizes the noise patterns to have a standard deviation of 1, standardizing the output. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The model parameter is optional and allows for the adjustment of the noise generation based on the model's characteristics, particularly when sigmas are provided. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `sigmas`: An optional parameter that, when provided, adjusts the noise intensity based on the sigma values, which can be crucial for specific generative tasks. Type should be `SIGMAS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: Outputs a dictionary containing the generated noise patterns, ready for use in further processing or as input to generative models. Type should be `LATENT`.
