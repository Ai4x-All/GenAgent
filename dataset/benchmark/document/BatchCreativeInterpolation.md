- `BatchCreativeInterpolation`: The Batch Creative Interpolation node is designed to facilitate the generation and manipulation of frame sequences in a batch processing manner. It leverages advanced interpolation techniques to creatively adjust and enhance video frames, enabling dynamic frame rate conversion, motion smoothing, and the introduction of novel visual effects. This node is particularly useful in applications requiring high-quality video processing, animation, and effects generation, where frame-by-frame control and precision are paramount.
