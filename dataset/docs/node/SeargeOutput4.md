- `SeargeOutput4`: SeargeOutput4 is designed to demultiplex model names and configurations for various components of a generative AI model, including base, refiner, VAE, and upscale models, as well as Lora models. It abstracts the complexity of handling multiple model configurations, streamlining the process of selecting and configuring the appropriate models for generation tasks.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `model_names`: Specifies the names and configurations of various models involved in the generation process, including base, refiner, VAE, main upscale, support upscale, and Lora models. It is crucial for determining the specific models to be used and their configurations. Type should be `MODEL_NAMES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model_names`: Returns the original dictionary of model names and configurations, facilitating access to model identifiers. Type should be `MODEL_NAMES`.
        - `base_model`: Identifies the base model used for initial generation. Type should be `CHECKPOINT_NAME`.
        - `refiner_model`: Specifies the refiner model for enhancing the initial generation. Type should be `CHECKPOINT_NAME`.
        - `vae_model`: Denotes the VAE model used for variational autoencoding tasks. Type should be `VAE_NAME`.
        - `main_upscale_model`: Indicates the primary upscale model for image resolution enhancement. Type should be `UPSCALER_NAME`.
        - `support_upscale_model`: Specifies the secondary upscale model, supporting the main upscale model. Type should be `UPSCALER_NAME`.
        - `lora_model`: Identifies the Lora model used for specific model adjustments or enhancements. Type should be `LORA_NAME`.
