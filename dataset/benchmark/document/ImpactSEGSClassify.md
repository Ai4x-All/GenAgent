- `ImpactSEGSClassify`: The ImpactSEGSClassify node is designed to classify segments (SEGS) based on specified criteria, comparing attributes or labels within each segment to filter and categorize them accordingly. This process involves evaluating conditions such as greater than, less than, or equal to, between attributes or label scores within the segments, facilitating advanced segmentation and classification tasks.
    - Inputs:
        - `classifier` (Required): The 'classifier' input specifies the classification model to be used for evaluating the segments. It plays a crucial role in determining the classification outcomes based on the model's capabilities. Type should be `TRANSFORMERS_CLASSIFIER`.
        - `segs` (Required): The 'segs' input represents the segments to be classified, serving as the primary data upon which classification conditions are applied. It is crucial for determining which segments meet the specified criteria and which do not, affecting the node's execution and results. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `preset_expr` (Required): The 'preset_expr' input allows for the selection of predefined classification expressions or the use of a manual expression. It defines the criteria for classification, impacting the filtering process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `manual_expr` (Required): The 'manual_expr' input is used when a custom classification expression is required, providing flexibility in defining specific conditions for segment classification. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `ref_image_opt` (Optional): The 'ref_image_opt' input is an optional parameter that specifies a reference image from which segments may be extracted or compared, enhancing the classification accuracy. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `filtered_SEGS`: The 'filtered_SEGS' output contains segments that meet the specified classification criteria, effectively separating them based on the comparison conditions applied. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `remained_SEGS`: The 'remained_SEGS' output includes segments that do not meet the classification criteria, allowing for further processing or exclusion from certain analyses. Type should be `SEGS`.
        - `detected_labels`: The 'detected_labels' output lists all unique labels identified during the classification process, offering insights into the variety of labels present within the segments. Type should be `STRING`.
