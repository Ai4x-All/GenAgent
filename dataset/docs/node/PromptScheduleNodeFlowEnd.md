- `PromptScheduleNodeFlowEnd`: This node represents the final step in a scheduling flow for processing and evaluating JSON data produced by preceding nodes. It focuses on finalizing the scheduling process by applying specific settings and adjustments to the input data, ensuring the output is ready for subsequent use or display.
    - Parameters:
        - `text`: The main text input that has been formatted and processed through the scheduling flow. It serves as the base content for final adjustments and evaluations in this node. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `max_frames`: Specifies the maximum number of frames to be considered in the scheduling process, affecting how the input text is evaluated and processed. Type should be `INT`.
        - `print_output`: A flag indicating whether the output should be printed, affecting the node's behavior in terms of displaying the processed results. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `current_frame`: Indicates the current frame being processed, which is crucial for determining the specific adjustments and evaluations to be applied based on the scheduling settings. Type should be `INT`.
        - `pre_text`: Optional pre-text that can be used to prepend to the main text input for additional context or instructions. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `app_text`: Optional appended text that can be added to the main text input for further details or instructions. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `pw_a`: A parameter weight that can influence the scheduling process by adjusting the importance or effect of certain inputs or settings. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_b`: A parameter weight similar to pw_a, providing an additional level of control over the scheduling adjustments. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_c`: Another parameter weight offering further customization of the scheduling process through its influence on input handling or output generation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_d`: The final parameter weight, allowing for comprehensive customization of the scheduling process by affecting various aspects of input processing and output generation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip`: A clip input that may influence the scheduling process by providing context or constraints related to media content. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `POS`: Represents a positive conditioning output, indicating a successful scheduling or processing outcome. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `NEG`: Denotes a negative conditioning output, signifying an unsuccessful scheduling or processing outcome that may require further adjustment. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
