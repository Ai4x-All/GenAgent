- `SeargeParameterProcessor`: The SeargeParameterProcessor node is designed to process and refine parameters for image generation tasks, incorporating advanced settings such as seed manipulation, style template adjustments, and high-resolution fix parameters. It acts as a central hub for configuring the generation process, ensuring that inputs like prompts, generation parameters, and model names are optimally adjusted for the desired output.
    - Inputs:
        - `inputs` (Required): Accepts a variety of parameters for processing, including but not limited to prompts, generation parameters, model names, and advanced settings, allowing for a comprehensive customization of the image generation process. Type should be `PARAMETER_INPUTS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `parameters`: Outputs a dictionary of processed parameters, ready for use in the image generation process, ensuring that all inputs have been optimally adjusted for the desired outcome. Type should be `PARAMETERS`.
