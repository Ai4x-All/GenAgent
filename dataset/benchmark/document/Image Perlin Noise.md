- `Image Perlin Noise`: The Image Perlin Noise node generates a Perlin noise pattern, a type of gradient noise often used for procedural texture generation. This node allows for the creation of complex, natural-looking textures by simulating the appearance of random variations in surfaces or materials.
    - Inputs:
        - `width` (Required): Specifies the width of the generated noise image. It determines the horizontal dimension of the output texture. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height` (Required): Defines the height of the generated noise image, affecting its vertical dimension. Type should be `INT`.
        - `scale` (Required): Controls the scale of the noise pattern, influencing the granularity and overall appearance of the texture. Type should be `INT`.
        - `octaves` (Required): Determines the number of layers of noise to be combined, affecting the complexity and detail of the final texture. Type should be `INT`.
        - `persistence` (Required): Adjusts the amplitude of each octave, influencing the contrast between high and low values in the noise pattern. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `seed` (Required): Sets the initial value for the noise generation algorithm, ensuring reproducibility of the noise pattern. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The generated Perlin noise image, which can be used as a texture or a basis for further graphical manipulations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
