- `easy wildcards`: The 'easy wildcards' node is designed to facilitate the dynamic substitution of placeholders within text strings with actual values. It leverages a dictionary of predefined wildcards, allowing for the customization and variation of text outputs based on specific keywords. This node supports complex patterns, including conditional selections and range-based selections, enhancing text generation processes with flexibility and adaptability.
    - Parameters:
        - `text`: The text string containing wildcards to be replaced. It serves as the input for dynamic text generation, where placeholders are substituted with corresponding values from the wildcard dictionary. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `Select to add LoRA`: Allows the selection of a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) configuration to be added to the text, enhancing the model's adaptability and performance with specific adjustments. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `Select to add Wildcard`: Enables the selection of predefined wildcards to be inserted into the text, facilitating dynamic text customization through the use of placeholders. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed`: An optional seed value for random number generation, ensuring consistency in wildcard replacements across different executions. Type should be `INT`.
        - `multiline_mode`: A boolean flag indicating whether the input text should be processed in multiline mode, affecting how wildcards and LoRAs are applied within the text. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `text`: The original text input before any processing. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `populated_text`: The text after all applicable wildcards and LoRA tags have been processed and replaced with their corresponding values, reflecting dynamic text customization. Type should be `STRING`.
