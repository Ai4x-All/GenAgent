- `ModelMergeSD1`: ModelMergeSD1 is designed for advanced model merging operations, specifically tailored to merge different aspects of two models into a single model. It allows for fine-grained control over the merging process by adjusting the influence of each model's components, such as input blocks, middle blocks, and output blocks, on the final merged model.
    - Parameters:
        - `time_embed.`: Adjusts the influence of the time embedding components from both models in the merged model. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `label_emb.`: Adjusts the influence of the label embedding components from both models in the merged model. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `input_blocks.i.`: Adjusts the influence of the ith input block from both models in the merged model. The index i ranges from 0 to 11. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `middle_block.i.`: Adjusts the influence of the ith middle block from both models in the merged model. The index i ranges from 0 to 2. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `output_blocks.i.`: Adjusts the influence of the ith output block from both models in the merged model. The index i ranges from 0 to 11. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `out.`: Adjusts the influence of the final output components from both models in the merged model. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model1`: The first model to be merged. It serves as the base model for the merging process. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `model2`: The second model to be merged. Its components are selectively integrated into the first model based on specified ratios. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The result of the merging process, a single model that integrates selected components and adjustments from the two input models. Type should be `MODEL`.
