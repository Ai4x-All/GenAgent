- `Fooocus_KSamplerAdvanced`: The `Fooocus_KSamplerAdvanced` node enhances the sampling process in art generation by incorporating a sharpness parameter, allowing for more precise control over the texture and detail in the generated artwork. This node builds upon the advanced sampling capabilities, integrating sharpness adjustments directly into the sampling workflow to refine the visual output.
    - Parameters:
        - `add_noise`: Determines whether noise is added to the sampling process, affecting the texture and detail of the generated artwork. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `noise_seed`: Sets the seed for noise generation, ensuring reproducibility in the artwork's texture and detail. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Defines the number of steps in the sampling process, impacting the refinement and detail of the generated artwork. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Controls the configuration for the sampling process, influencing the balance between the model's guidance and the generated detail. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Selects the specific sampler to use, affecting the method of traversing the model's latent space. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Chooses the scheduler for the sampling process, determining the progression of steps. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `start_at_step`: Specifies the starting step for the sampling process, allowing for mid-process intervention. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_at_step`: Defines the ending step for the sampling process, determining its completion point. Type should be `INT`.
        - `return_with_leftover_noise`: Controls whether the output includes leftover noise, affecting the final texture. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `sharpness`: The `sharpness` parameter allows users to adjust the level of detail and texture in the generated artwork, offering a means to fine-tune the visual output for more precise artistic control. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: Specifies the model used for the sampling process, serving as the core component for generating artwork. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `positive`: Provides positive conditioning to guide the sampling towards desired attributes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Provides negative conditioning to steer the sampling away from undesired attributes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent_image`: Inputs an initial latent image for the sampling process, serving as a starting point. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The output latent representation of the sampled artwork, reflecting the combined effects of all input parameters. Type should be `LATENT`.
