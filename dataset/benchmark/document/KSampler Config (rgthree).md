- `KSampler Config (rgthree)`: The KSampler Config node in the rgthree context is designed to configure the sampling process for image generation, particularly focusing on the steps involved, refinement options, and the selection of samplers and schedulers. It abstracts the complexity of configuring various parameters for the sampling process, making it easier for users to customize their image generation pipeline.
    - Inputs:
        - `steps_total` (Required): Specifies the total number of steps for the sampling process, allowing users to control the depth of the generation process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `refiner_step` (Required): Determines the step at which refinement should begin, enabling finer control over the image refinement process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg` (Required): Controls the conditioning factor, influencing the guidance and quality of the generated images. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name` (Required): Selects the specific sampler to be used in the generation process, offering flexibility in choosing the sampling strategy. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler` (Required): Chooses the scheduler for controlling the sampling process, allowing for different pacing and progression strategies. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Outputs:
        - `STEPS`: The total number of steps configured for the sampling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `REFINER_STEP`: The configured step at which refinement begins in the sampling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `CFG`: The conditioning factor set for guiding the image generation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `SAMPLER`: The name of the sampler selected for the generation process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `SCHEDULER`: The scheduler chosen to control the progression of the sampling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
