- `CR Random Weight LoRA`: The CR_RandomWeightLoRA node is designed to manage and manipulate LoRA (Locally Reweighted Approximations) weights within a specified range, incorporating randomness and conditional logic based on the provided parameters. It facilitates the dynamic adjustment of LoRA weights, enabling more flexible and adaptive model behavior.
    - Parameters:
        - `stride`: Defines the interval at which the LoRA weights are potentially randomized, affecting the frequency of weight adjustments. Type should be `INT`.
        - `force_randomize_after_stride`: Determines whether to force a re-randomization of weights after a specified number of strides, enhancing the variability of model behavior. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lora_name`: Identifies the specific LoRA instance to be manipulated, serving as a key for tracking and adjusting its weight. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `switch`: Controls whether the LoRA weight adjustment is active ('On') or bypassed ('Off'), allowing for conditional execution. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `weight_min`: Sets the minimum boundary for the random weight selection, constraining the range of possible weights. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `weight_max`: Defines the maximum limit for the random weight selection, establishing the upper boundary of the weight range. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `clip_weight`: Specifies a clipping value for the LoRA weight, ensuring that the weight does not exceed this threshold. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `lora_stack`: Optionally provides a stack of existing LoRA instances for integration or modification, allowing for cumulative adjustments. Type should be `LORA_STACK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `lora_stack`: Returns a stack of LoRA instances with their adjusted weights, ready for further processing or application. Type should be `LORA_STACK`.
