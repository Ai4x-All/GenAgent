- `TimestepKeyframe`: The TimestepKeyframe node is designed to encapsulate the concept of a keyframe within a timeline, specifying the start percentage, strength, and optional control weights, latent keyframes, and mask hints. It serves as a foundational element for defining and manipulating keyframes in advanced control networks, enabling precise control over the animation or transformation process.
    - Parameters:
        - `start_percent`: Specifies the starting point of the keyframe as a percentage of the total timeline, allowing for precise positioning within the sequence. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `strength`: Determines the influence or intensity of the keyframe, enabling the modulation of effects or transformations applied at this point in the timeline. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `null_latent_kf_strength`: Specifies the strength of a null or default latent keyframe, used when no specific latent keyframe is provided. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `inherit_missing`: A boolean flag indicating whether missing attributes should be inherited from previous keyframes, ensuring continuity in the animation or transformation process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `guarantee_usage`: A boolean flag that guarantees the usage of this keyframe, ensuring it is considered in the animation or transformation process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `prev_timestep_kf`: References a previous timestep keyframe, enabling the chaining or sequencing of keyframes over time. Type should be `TIMESTEP_KEYFRAME`.
        - `cn_weights`: Optional control weights that can be applied to the keyframe, providing additional control over the effects or transformations. Type should be `CONTROL_NET_WEIGHTS`.
        - `latent_keyframe`: Optional latent keyframes that can be associated with this keyframe, allowing for complex transformations or animations. Type should be `LATENT_KEYFRAME`.
        - `mask_optional`: Optional mask hints that can be associated with the keyframe, providing additional control over the areas affected by the transformations. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `TIMESTEP_KF`: Returns a modified or new timestep keyframe, incorporating the specified parameters and potentially adding it to a sequence of keyframes. Type should be `TIMESTEP_KEYFRAME`.
