- `ReActorBuildFaceModel`: This node is designed to construct a face model from a provided image, utilizing face detection and analysis to identify and extract facial features. It aims to create a detailed face model that can be used for various face manipulation tasks within the ReActor framework.
    - Parameters:
        - `save_mode`: Indicates whether the face model should be saved after creation, affecting the workflow of model handling and storage. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `send_only`: This parameter determines if only the face model's name should be sent back, without the actual model data, to optimize data transfer. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `face_model_name`: The name under which the face model will be saved. This parameter is essential for identifying and retrieving the model in subsequent operations. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `compute_method`: Defines the method used for computing the face model, allowing for flexibility in the face detection and analysis process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: A batch of images from which to build face models, enabling the processing of multiple images in a single operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `face_models`: A collection of existing face models to be processed or analyzed further, providing a way to handle multiple models efficiently. Type should be `FACE_MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `face_model`: The constructed face model or an error message if the process fails. Type should be `FACE_MODEL`.
