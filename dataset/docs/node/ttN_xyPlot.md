- `ttN xyPlot`: The `ttN xyPlot` node is designed for generating and processing XY plots within a specific visualization framework. It focuses on validating plot types, managing plot variables, and orchestrating the generation of images based on XY coordinates. This node integrates various functionalities to ensure the creation of visual representations is both efficient and adaptable to different types of data inputs.
    - Parameters:
        - `grid_spacing`: Determines the spacing between grid points in the plot, affecting the plot's resolution and visual density. Type should be `INT`.
        - `latent_id`: Identifies a specific latent variable to be used in the plot, influencing the data representation and visualization. Type should be `INT`.
        - `output_individuals`: Controls whether individual data points are outputted, impacting the level of detail in the plot visualization. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `flip_xy`: Specifies whether the X and Y axes should be flipped, altering the plot's orientation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `x_axis`: Defines the data type or category for the X-axis, shaping how data is interpreted and plotted. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `x_values`: A list of values to be plotted on the X-axis, determining the specific points and their arrangement in the plot. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `y_axis`: Specifies the data type or category for the Y-axis, influencing the plot's data interpretation and visualization. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `y_values`: A collection of values for plotting on the Y-axis, which dictates the plot points and their organization. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `xyPlot`: The generated XY plot data, encapsulating the visual representation of the plotted points. Type should be `XYPLOT`.
