- `ReverseImageBatch`: The ReverseImageBatch node is designed to manipulate a batch of images by reversing their order. This functionality is useful in scenarios where the sequence of images needs to be processed or viewed in reverse order, providing flexibility in handling image data within a batch.
    - Inputs:
        - `images` (Required): The 'images' parameter represents the batch of images to be reversed. It is crucial for determining the order in which the images will be processed, directly affecting the output by reversing this order. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is a batch of images with their order reversed from the input batch, allowing for reversed sequence processing or visualization. Type should be `IMAGE`.
