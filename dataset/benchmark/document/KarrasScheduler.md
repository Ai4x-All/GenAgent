- `KarrasScheduler`: The KarrasScheduler node is designed to generate a sequence of noise levels (sigmas) based on the Karras et al. (2022) noise schedule. It calculates these levels using specific parameters to control the noise intensity over a given number of steps, facilitating controlled diffusion processes in generative models.
    - Inputs:
        - `steps` (Required): Specifies the number of noise levels to generate, controlling the granularity of the diffusion process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `sigma_max` (Required): Sets the maximum noise level, defining the upper bound of noise intensity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sigma_min` (Required): Determines the minimum noise level, establishing the lower bound of noise intensity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `rho` (Required): A parameter influencing the shape of the noise schedule, affecting how noise levels progress from sigma_min to sigma_max. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `sigmas`: A sequence of calculated noise levels (sigmas) according to the Karras et al. (2022) noise schedule. Type should be `SIGMAS`.
