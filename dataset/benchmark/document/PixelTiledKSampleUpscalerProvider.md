        - `negative` (Required): A negative text prompt to steer the image generation away from undesired attributes. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `denoise` (Required): The level of denoising applied to the samples, refining the clarity and quality of the upscaled image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `tile_width` (Required): The width of each tile in the tiling strategy, determining the granularity of the upscaling process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `tile_height` (Required): The height of each tile, which, along with tile width, defines the tiling pattern and affects the upscaling precision. Type should be `INT`.
        - `tiling_strategy` (Required): Describes the strategy for laying out tiles during the upscaling process, influencing the overall efficiency and quality of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `upscale_model_opt` (Optional): Optional upscale model to enhance the upscaling process with a specific algorithm or technique. Type should be `UPSCALE_MODEL`.
        - `pk_hook_opt` (Optional): Optional post-processing hook to apply custom operations or adjustments after the upscaling process. Type should be `PK_HOOK`.
