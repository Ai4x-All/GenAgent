- `ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted`: The ADE_NoiseLayerAddWeighted node specializes in enhancing the noise layering process by applying a weighted addition of noise to an existing noise layer. It leverages a balance multiplier to fine-tune the impact of new noise on the existing noise structure, aiming to achieve a more controlled and nuanced noise integration.
    - Parameters:
        - `batch_offset`: Specifies the offset for batch processing, affecting how noise is applied across different batches. Type should be `INT`.
        - `noise_type`: Defines the type of noise to be added, influencing the characteristics of the noise applied. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed_gen_override`: Allows for overriding the default seed generation mechanism, enabling custom noise generation patterns. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed_offset`: Determines the offset applied to the seed value, facilitating varied noise generation outcomes. Type should be `INT`.
        - `noise_weight`: Controls the weight of the new noise being added, allowing for adjustment of the noise's influence on the existing layer. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `balance_multiplier`: Adjusts the balance between the old and new noise, fine-tuning the overall effect of noise addition. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `seed_override`: Provides an option to override the seed value used for noise generation, offering control over the randomness aspect. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `prev_noise_layers`: Represents the previous state of noise layers, enabling sequential layering of noise for complex effects. Type should be `NOISE_LAYERS`.
        - `mask_optional`: An optional mask that can be applied to selectively influence the noise addition process, providing further control over the noise characteristics. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `noise_layers`: Outputs the updated noise layer group after the addition of the weighted noise layer, reflecting the new state of noise layering. Type should be `NOISE_LAYERS`.
