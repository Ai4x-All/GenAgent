- `ttN pipeEDIT`: The node is designed to edit and refine the outputs of a pipeline, allowing for adjustments and enhancements to be made to the data processed through the pipeline. It focuses on modifying existing pipeline data to meet specific requirements or to improve the quality of the output.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: Specifies the seed component of the pipeline to be edited or refined. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Represents the pipeline data to be edited or refined. This parameter is crucial for determining the scope and nature of the edits to be applied. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model`: Specifies the model component of the pipeline to be edited or refined. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `pos`: Specifies the positive conditioning component of the pipeline to be edited or refined. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `neg`: Specifies the negative conditioning component of the pipeline to be edited or refined. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent`: Specifies the latent component of the pipeline to be edited or refined. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `vae`: Specifies the VAE component of the pipeline to be edited or refined. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `clip`: Specifies the CLIP component of the pipeline to be edited or refined. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `image`: Specifies the image component of the pipeline to be edited or refined. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The edited pipeline data, reflecting the applied modifications. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model`: The edited model component of the pipeline. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `pos`: The edited positive conditioning component of the pipeline. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `neg`: The edited negative conditioning component of the pipeline. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent`: The edited latent component of the pipeline. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `vae`: The edited VAE component of the pipeline. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `clip`: The edited CLIP component of the pipeline. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `image`: The edited image component of the pipeline. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `seed`: The edited seed component of the pipeline. Type should be `INT`.
