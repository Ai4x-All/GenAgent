- `Inference_Core_OneFormer-COCO-SemSegPreprocessor`: This node is designed for semantic segmentation tasks using the OneFormer model specifically trained on the COCO dataset. It preprocesses images to facilitate semantic segmentation, leveraging a pretrained OneFormer model to analyze and segment the input image into different semantic categories.
    - Parameters:
        - `resolution`: The resolution parameter specifies the desired output resolution of the segmented image. It affects the granularity and quality of the semantic segmentation performed by the OneFormer model. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be semantically segmented. This image is processed by the OneFormer model to identify and categorize different semantic elements within the image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is a semantically segmented image, where each pixel is classified into one of the semantic categories defined by the COCO dataset. Type should be `IMAGE`.
