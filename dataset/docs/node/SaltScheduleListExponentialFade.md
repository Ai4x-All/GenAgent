- `SaltScheduleListExponentialFade`: This node applies an exponential fade effect to a schedule list based on the specified fade type and strength, enhancing or diminishing the values in the list to create dynamic transitions.
    - Parameters:
        - `fade_type`: Specifies the type of fade effect to apply: 'in' for a gradual increase, 'out' for a gradual decrease, or 'in-and-out' for a combination of both. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `strength`: Determines the intensity of the fade effect, with higher values resulting in more pronounced fades. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_index`: The index in the schedule list from which to start applying the fade effect, allowing for partial fades within the list. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `schedule_list`: The list of values to apply the exponential fade effect to, serving as the base for dynamic transitions. Type should be `LIST`.
    - Outputs:
        - `schedule_list`: The modified schedule list after applying the exponential fade effect, showcasing the dynamic transitions. Type should be `LIST`.
