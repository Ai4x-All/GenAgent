- `Batch Crop Resize Inplace`: This node is designed to perform in-place cropping and resizing operations on a batch of images. It aims to modify the dimensions of each image in the batch according to specified parameters, optimizing the images for further processing or analysis.
    - Parameters:
        - `image_directory`: Specifies the directory containing the images to be processed. This parameter is crucial for locating and loading the images for subsequent cropping and resizing operations. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `subdirectories`: Indicates whether to include subdirectories within the specified image directory for processing. This parameter allows for more comprehensive image selection. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `replace_original`: Determines whether the original images should be replaced with the processed versions. This parameter affects how the output images are saved. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `replace_suffix`: Specifies the suffix to be added to the filenames of processed images when not replacing the original images. This parameter helps in identifying the modified images. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `upscale_method`: Defines the method to be used for upscaling the images during the resizing process. This parameter influences the quality and dimensions of the output images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `crop`: Specifies the cropping method to be applied to the images. This parameter determines how the images are cropped before resizing. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `crop_amount`: Determines the proportion of the image to be cropped. This parameter directly influences the final dimensions of the images, playing a key role in the resizing process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `job_done`: The output is a string message indicating the completion of the processing job, including the number of images processed. This provides a summary of the operation's outcome. Type should be `STRING`.
