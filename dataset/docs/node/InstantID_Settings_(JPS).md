- `InstantID Settings (JPS)`: This node is designed to configure settings for generating an InstantID, allowing customization of various parameters such as influence weight, strength, noise level, and start/end points of the ID generation process.
    - Parameters:
        - `ip_weight`: Defines the influence weight of the InstantID, affecting its overall impact on the generation process. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `cn_strength`: Sets the strength of the content noise, influencing the variability and uniqueness of the generated InstantID. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `noise`: Specifies the level of noise to be added to the InstantID, contributing to its randomness and complexity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start`: Determines the starting point of the InstantID generation, allowing for phased or gradual application. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end`: Defines the ending point of the InstantID generation, marking the completion of its application. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `instantid_settings`: Outputs the configured settings for InstantID as a tuple, ready for use in the generation process. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
