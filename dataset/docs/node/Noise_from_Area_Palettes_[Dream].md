- `Noise from Area Palettes [Dream]`: The 'Noise from Area Palettes' node generates a noise-based image by blending colors from different area-specific palettes. It utilizes a unique area sharpness parameter to influence the randomness and distribution of colors across specified areas, creating a visually cohesive noise pattern.
    - Parameters:
        - `area_sharpness`: Controls the sharpness of the transitions between different area palettes, influencing how distinctly the areas are defined. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `width`: The width of the generated image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The height of the generated image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blur_amount`: The amount of blur applied to the noise, affecting the smoothness of the color transitions. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `density`: Determines the density of the noise pattern, influencing the overall texture and complexity of the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `seed`: A seed value for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility of the noise pattern. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `top_left_palette`: Specifies the palette for the top-left area of the image, influencing the color scheme in that specific section. Type should be `RGB_PALETTE`.
        - `top_center_palette`: Defines the palette for the top-center area, affecting the color distribution and theme in this particular region. Type should be `RGB_PALETTE`.
        - `top_right_palette`: Determines the palette for the top-right area, impacting the color choices and overall aesthetic in that zone. Type should be `RGB_PALETTE`.
        - `center_left_palette`: Sets the palette for the center-left area, guiding the color scheme and visual harmony in this segment. Type should be `RGB_PALETTE`.
        - `center_palette`: Indicates the palette for the central area of the image, influencing the core color theme and distribution. Type should be `RGB_PALETTE`.
        - `center_right_palette`: Specifies the palette for the center-right area, affecting the color dynamics and visual appeal in this section. Type should be `RGB_PALETTE`.
        - `bottom_left_palette`: Determines the palette for the bottom-left area, impacting the color scheme and aesthetic consistency in this part. Type should be `RGB_PALETTE`.
        - `bottom_center_palette`: Sets the palette for the bottom-center area, guiding the color choices and thematic consistency in this region. Type should be `RGB_PALETTE`.
        - `bottom_right_palette`: Defines the palette for the bottom-right area, affecting the color distribution and visual impact in this zone. Type should be `RGB_PALETTE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The generated image, composed of noise patterns derived from the specified area palettes. Type should be `IMAGE`.
