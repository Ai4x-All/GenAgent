    - Inputs:
        - `frames_per_image` (Required): Specifies the number of frames to be associated with each image, affecting the output string format by determining the numerical prefix for each string. Type should be `INT`.
        - `new_order` (Optional): Defines a custom order for the strings to be rearranged. If provided, strings are reordered according to the indices specified in this parameter. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `string`: Outputs a reordered list of strings, formatted with frame numbers as prefixes, based on the input order and frames per image. Type should be `STRING`.
