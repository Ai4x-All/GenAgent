- `AMT VFI`: The AMT_VFI node specializes in video frame interpolation, utilizing deep learning techniques to generate intermediate frames that enhance the smoothness and frame rate of video sequences. It employs advanced models to predict and insert frames between existing ones, improving video playback quality.
    - Parameters:
        - `ckpt_name`: Specifies the checkpoint name for the model to be used in the interpolation process, determining the specific pre-trained model configuration. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clear_cache_after_n_frames`: Controls the frequency of cache clearing to manage memory usage during the interpolation process, affecting performance and resource utilization. Type should be `INT`.
        - `multiplier`: Determines the number of intermediate frames to be generated between each pair of original frames, directly influencing the output video's frame rate. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `frames`: The input video frames to be interpolated, provided as a tensor. This parameter is crucial for defining the sequence of frames the model will process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `optional_interpolation_states`: An optional parameter that allows for the customization of interpolation states, offering flexibility in handling specific frames or conditions. Type should be `INTERPOLATION_STATES`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output video frames after interpolation, showcasing the enhanced fluidity and increased frame rate achieved through the process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
