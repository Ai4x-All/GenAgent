- `VHS_VAEDecodeBatched`: This node is designed for batch processing of latent representations to decode them into images using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). It efficiently handles large sets of latent samples by decoding them in smaller, manageable batches, updating progress through a progress bar for better user experience.
    - Inputs:
        - `samples` (Required): The latent representations to be decoded into images. This input is crucial for the node's operation as it specifies the data that will undergo the decoding process. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `vae` (Required): The Variational Autoencoder model used for decoding the latent representations into images. It defines the specific VAE architecture and parameters to be used in the decoding process. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `per_batch` (Required): Specifies the number of samples to be decoded in each batch. This allows for efficient memory management and processing speed by breaking down the workload into smaller chunks. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The decoded images from the latent representations. This output provides the visual content generated by the VAE model from the input latent samples. Type should be `IMAGE`.
