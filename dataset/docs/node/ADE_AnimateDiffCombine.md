- `ADE_AnimateDiffCombine`: Originally designed for combining multiple animation frames into a cohesive sequence, this node facilitates the creation of complex animations from individual frames.
    - Parameters:
        - `frame_rate`: Specifies the playback speed of the combined animation sequence, determining how fast the frames are displayed. Type should be `INT`.
        - `loop_count`: Defines how many times the animation sequence will repeat, with a value of 0 indicating infinite looping. Type should be `INT`.
        - `filename_prefix`: The prefix for the output file name, aiding in the organization and identification of generated animations. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `format`: The format of the output animation file, such as GIF, allowing for customization of the output type. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `pingpong`: A boolean indicating whether the animation should play forwards and then backwards, creating a seamless looping effect. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `save_image`: Determines whether the combined animation sequence should be saved as an image file, providing flexibility in output handling. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: A collection of animation frames to be combined into a single sequence, supporting the creation of complex animations from individual frames. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `gif`: The resulting animation file, combining the input frames according to the specified parameters. Type should be `GIF`.
