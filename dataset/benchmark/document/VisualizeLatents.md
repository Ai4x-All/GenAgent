- `VisualizeLatents`: The VisualizeLatents node transforms latent space representations into visualizable images, adjusting their mean and standard deviation for better visual interpretation. It organizes the visualized latents into a grid layout based on the square root of the number of channels, facilitating the examination of latent space features.
    - Inputs:
        - `latent` (Required): The 'latent' input is a dictionary containing the latent space samples to be visualized. It is crucial for generating the visual representation of the latent space, affecting the output image's appearance and layout. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is an image tensor representing the visualized latent space, adjusted for better visual interpretation and organized in a grid layout. Type should be `IMAGE`.
