- `ImageNoiseGaussian`: The ImageNoiseGaussian node applies Gaussian noise to images, allowing for the adjustment of noise strength and the option to apply the noise monochromatically or invert the noise effect. It operates on a per-channel basis, providing flexibility in how noise is applied across different image channels.
    - Parameters:
        - `strength`: Defines the strength of the Gaussian noise to be applied to the images. This parameter directly influences the intensity of the noise effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `monochromatic`: Determines whether the noise should be applied monochromatically across all channels or individually per channel, affecting the visual outcome of the noise application. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `invert`: When set to true, inverts the noise effect, subtracting the noise from the images instead of adding it, which can lead to different visual effects. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `channels`: Specifies the channels of the image to which the noise should be applied, allowing for targeted noise application on specific color channels. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The input images to which Gaussian noise will be applied. This parameter is crucial for defining the base images that will undergo noise addition. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output images with Gaussian noise applied, reflecting the specified strength, monochromatic setting, and inversion preference. Type should be `IMAGE`.
