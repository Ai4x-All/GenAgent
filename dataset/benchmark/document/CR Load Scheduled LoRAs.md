- `CR Load Scheduled LoRAs`: This node is designed to dynamically load and apply LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) configurations based on a predefined schedule. It supports loading specific LoRAs for given frames, handling default LoRA settings, and operating in different modes such as 'Off' or 'Load default LoRA'. The node aims to enhance model performance or behavior for animation or image generation tasks by adjusting model and clip strengths according to the scheduled LoRA parameters.
    - Inputs:
        - `mode` (Required): Specifies the operational mode of the node, which can include 'Off', 'Load default LoRA', or dynamically loading LoRAs based on a schedule. This affects how and whether LoRAs are applied. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `model` (Required): The model to which the LoRA adjustments will be applied. It is a core component of the node's functionality. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `clip` (Required): The clip to which the LoRA adjustments will be applied, alongside the model. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `current_frame` (Required): The current frame number for which the node is determining which LoRA, if any, to apply. This is crucial for dynamic LoRA loading based on the schedule. Type should be `INT`.
        - `schedule_alias` (Required): An alias for the schedule, potentially used for identifying or categorizing the schedule in a more human-readable form. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `default_lora` (Required): Specifies the default LoRA to be used when no specific LoRA is scheduled for the current frame or when operating in 'Load default LoRA' mode. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `strength_model` (Required): The strength parameter for the model when loading the default LoRA or a scheduled LoRA. It influences the intensity of the applied LoRA on the model. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `strength_clip` (Required): The strength parameter for the clip when loading the default LoRA or a scheduled LoRA. It influences the intensity of the applied LoRA on the clip. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `schedule_format` (Required): Defines the format of the schedule used for loading LoRAs. It can vary, affecting how the schedule is interpreted and applied. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lora_list` (Optional): A list of available LoRAs that can be scheduled. It provides the node with options for dynamic LoRA loading. Type should be `LORA_LIST`.
        - `schedule` (Optional): The schedule detailing which LoRA to load at specific frames. It is used when the node is in a mode that requires dynamic LoRA loading based on frame numbers. Type should be `SCHEDULE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `MODEL`: The model after potentially being modified by the application of a LoRA, based on the node's operational mode and schedule. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `CLIP`: The clip after potentially being modified by the application of a LoRA, based on the node's operational mode and schedule. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `show_help`: A URL providing help or documentation related to the node's functionality and usage. Type should be `STRING`.
