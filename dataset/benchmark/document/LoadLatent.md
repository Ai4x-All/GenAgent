    - Inputs:
        - `latent` (Required): Specifies the name of the latent file to be loaded. This file should be located in a predefined input directory and have a '.latent' extension. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: Provides the loaded and adjusted latent tensor, ready for further processing or generation tasks. Type should be `LATENT`.
