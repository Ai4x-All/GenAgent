- `Animation Builder (mtb)`: The MTB_AnimationBuilder node is designed to facilitate the creation of animations by managing frame sequencing, scaling, and looping. It provides a structured approach to generating animations through a set of parameters that control the total number of frames, their scaling, and the number of loops, thereby enabling the creation of complex animation sequences with ease.
    - Inputs:
        - `total_frames` (Required): Specifies the total number of frames to be generated for the animation. This parameter directly influences the length of the animation sequence. Type should be `INT`.
        - `scale_float` (Required): A scaling factor applied to the normalized current value, which is a float between 0 and 1, to adjust the animation's scaling over its duration. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `loop_count` (Required): Determines the number of times the animation sequence is looped, allowing for repeated cycles of the animation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `raw_iteration` (Required): An internal counter used to track the current iteration within the animation loop, facilitating frame sequencing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `raw_loop` (Required): An internal counter used to track the current loop iteration, supporting the looping functionality of the animation. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `frame`: The current frame number in the animation sequence. Type should be `INT`.
        - `0-1 (scaled)`: The scaled value of the current frame, normalized between 0 and 1, adjusted by the scale factor. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `count`: The current count of loops that have been completed in the animation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `loop_ended`: A boolean indicating whether the current loop of the animation has ended. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
