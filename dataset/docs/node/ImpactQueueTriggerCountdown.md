- `ImpactQueueTriggerCountdown`: This node is designed to manage a countdown mechanism within a queue system, triggering specific actions based on the countdown progress and conditional logic. It effectively integrates with external systems to update and control the flow of operations based on the countdown state.
    - Parameters:
        - `count`: Represents the current count in the countdown process, affecting the node's decision to trigger the next step or reset. Type should be `INT`.
        - `total`: Defines the total count for the countdown, determining when the countdown should reset. Type should be `INT`.
        - `mode`: A boolean flag that controls whether the countdown mechanism is active, influencing the node's behavior in triggering or not triggering actions. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `signal`: An optional input that can carry additional information or control signals through the node's operation. Type should be `*`.
    - Outputs:
        - `signal_opt`: Optionally returns the input signal, allowing for conditional data flow through the node. Type should be `*`.
        - `count`: Returns the updated count after the node's operation, reflecting the countdown's progress. Type should be `INT`.
        - `total`: Returns the total count value, unchanged from the input, to maintain consistency in the data flow. Type should be `INT`.
