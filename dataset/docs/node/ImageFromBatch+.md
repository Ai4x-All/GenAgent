- `ImageFromBatch+`: The `ImageFromBatch` node extracts a specific range of images from a batch based on the provided start index and length, allowing for selective processing or analysis of batched image data.
    - Parameters:
        - `start`: Specifies the starting index within the batch from which images will be extracted. This parameter determines the beginning of the subset to be processed. Type should be `INT`.
        - `length`: Defines the number of images to extract from the specified starting index. This parameter controls the size of the subset to be processed. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The batched image input from which a subset will be extracted. This parameter is crucial for specifying the source of the images to be processed. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The extracted subset of images from the original batch, based on the specified start index and length. Type should be `IMAGE`.
