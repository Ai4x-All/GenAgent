- `ReverseImageBatch`: Reverses the order of images in a batch, providing a simple yet effective method for manipulating image sequences.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The batch of images to be reversed. This input is crucial for determining the order in which images will appear in the output. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The batch of images after being reversed in order. This output is essential for applications requiring a specific sequence of images. Type should be `IMAGE`.
