- `CR XY Index`: The CR XY Index node is designed to calculate the X and Y positions in a grid based on a given index. It facilitates the organization and navigation of elements within a grid structure by converting a linear index into two-dimensional coordinates.
    - Inputs:
        - `x_columns` (Required): Specifies the number of columns in the grid. It determines how the index is translated into the X coordinate, affecting the grid's horizontal layout. Type should be `INT`.
        - `y_rows` (Required): Defines the number of rows in the grid. It influences the calculation of the Y coordinate from the index, impacting the grid's vertical structure. Type should be `INT`.
        - `index` (Required): The linear index to be converted into X and Y coordinates. This index helps in locating a specific element within the grid structure. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `x`: The calculated X coordinate in the grid, derived from the provided index. Type should be `INT`.
        - `y`: The Y coordinate in the grid, calculated based on the index and the grid dimensions. Type should be `INT`.
        - `show_help`: A URL to a help page providing detailed information and guidance on using the CR XY Index node. Type should be `STRING`.
