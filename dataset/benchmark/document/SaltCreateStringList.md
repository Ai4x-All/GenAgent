- `SaltCreateStringList`: This node is designed to create a list containing a single string element. It serves as a utility for initializing a list structure with a specified string, facilitating operations that require list input formats.
    - Inputs:
        - `string_input` (Required): The string to be initialized into a list. This parameter is crucial for defining the sole element of the newly created list, setting the foundation for further list-based manipulations. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Outputs:
        - `string_list`: The output is a list containing the initial string input as its only element. This list is ready for further processing or manipulation in subsequent operations. Type should be `LIST`.
