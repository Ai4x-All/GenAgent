- `Text Find and Replace by Dictionary`: This node performs a search and replace operation on a given text using a dictionary. It identifies specific terms within the text, marked by a customizable replacement key, and replaces them with random selections from lists associated with those terms in the dictionary. The operation can be influenced by a seed for reproducible randomness.
    - Parameters:
        - `text`: The input text to be processed. It serves as the base content for search and replace operations. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `replacement_key`: A string used to mark the beginning and end of terms in the text that should be replaced. It helps in identifying the exact terms to be replaced. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `seed`: An integer used to seed the random number generator for reproducible randomness in the selection of replacements. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `dictionary`: A dictionary where keys represent terms to be replaced in the text, and values are lists of possible replacements. Type should be `DICT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `string`: The modified text after search and replace operations have been performed, with specific terms replaced by random selections from the dictionary. Type should be `STRING`.
