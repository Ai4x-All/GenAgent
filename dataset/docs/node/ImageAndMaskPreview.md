- `ImageAndMaskPreview`: The ImageAndMaskPreview node is designed to generate previews of images with optional masks applied. It can adjust the opacity and color of the mask before overlaying it on the image, or simply return the image or mask alone if the other is not provided. This functionality is useful for visually inspecting the effect of masks on images within a workflow.
    - Parameters:
        - `mask_opacity`: Specifies the opacity level of the mask when it is applied to the image, affecting the visibility of the mask overlay. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `mask_color`: Defines the color of the mask in 'R, G, B' format, which is used when both mask and image are provided, to colorize the mask before applying it to the image. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `pass_through`: Determines whether the processed preview should be returned directly or saved to a file. When true, the preview is returned; otherwise, it is saved. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The image to which the mask may be applied. If only the image is provided, it is returned as the preview. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: The mask to be applied to the image. If only the mask is provided, it is transformed into a preview format. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `composite`: The node returns a composite image when both an image and a mask are provided, applying the mask with specified opacity and color adjustments to the image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
