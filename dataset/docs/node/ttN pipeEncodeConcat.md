- `ttN pipeEncodeConcat`: The ttN pipeEncodeConcat node is designed to enhance and concatenate conditioning information within a pipeline, utilizing advanced encoding techniques to refine and merge textual conditioning inputs for improved model guidance.
    - Parameters:
        - `toggle`: A boolean flag that determines whether the encoding and concatenation process should be executed. Type should be `COMBO[BOOLEAN]`.
        - `positive`: An optional positive textual input for conditioning, intended to guide the model towards generating content aligned with specified attributes. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `positive_token_normalization`: Specifies the method for normalizing tokens in the positive conditioning, affecting how the model interprets and weights these tokens. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `positive_weight_interpretation`: Defines how the weights are interpreted in the positive conditioning, influencing the model's generation process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `negative`: An optional negative textual input for conditioning, used to guide the model away from generating content with specified attributes. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `negative_token_normalization`: Specifies the method for normalizing tokens in the negative conditioning, affecting the model's interpretation and weighting of these tokens. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `negative_weight_interpretation`: Defines how the weights are interpreted in the negative conditioning, influencing the model's generation process in contrast to the positive conditioning. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Represents the pipeline state, including model, conditioning, and other relevant settings, serving as the foundation for the encoding and concatenation process. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `optional_positive_from`: Optional advanced conditioning input for positive guidance, allowing for more nuanced and specific model direction. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `optional_negative_from`: Optional advanced conditioning input for negative guidance, enabling more detailed and targeted model influence. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `optional_clip`: An optional CLIP model parameter that can be used to further refine the conditioning process with visual guidance. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The updated pipeline state, including the newly encoded and concatenated conditioning information. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `positive`: The enhanced and concatenated positive conditioning output, ready for guiding the model's generation. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: The enhanced and concatenated negative conditioning output, tailored to provide nuanced guidance against the positive conditioning. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `clip`: The CLIP model parameter, potentially updated through the encoding and concatenation process, to further refine visual guidance. Type should be `CLIP`.
