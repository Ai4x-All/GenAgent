- `Floats To Float (mtb)`: Provides a conversion utility to transform a list of floats into a single float value, facilitating compatibility with other extensions that use a single float to represent multiple values.
    - Inputs:
        - `floats` (Required): The list of floats to be converted into a single float value. This input is crucial for the conversion process, determining the output of the node. Type should be `FLOATS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `float`: The single float value resulting from the conversion of the input list of floats. Type should be `FLOAT`.
