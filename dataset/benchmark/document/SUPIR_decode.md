- `SUPIR_decode`: The SUPIR_decode node is designed for decoding latent representations into images using a specific VAE model within the SUPIR framework. It focuses on reconstructing images from their encoded state, potentially after modifications or processing in the latent space, thereby enabling the generation of images or the restoration of details from compressed or abstract representations.
    - Inputs:
        - `SUPIR_VAE` (Required): The VAE model used for decoding. It is crucial for the decoding process as it defines the architecture and parameters that will be used to reconstruct the image from its latent representation. Type should be `SUPIRVAE`.
        - `latents` (Required): The latent representation of an image that is to be decoded. This input is essential for the reconstruction process, as it contains the compressed information that will be expanded back into an image. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `use_tiled_vae` (Required): A flag indicating whether to use a tiled approach for the VAE decoding. This affects the decoding process by potentially improving the handling of large images or enhancing performance on certain hardware configurations. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `decoder_tile_size` (Required): Specifies the size of the tiles when using a tiled VAE decoding approach. This parameter is critical for determining the resolution and detail in the reconstructed image, affecting the overall quality and efficiency of the decoding process. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The image resulting from the decoding process. It represents the final output where the latent representation has been transformed back into visual form, showcasing the reconstructed or generated image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
