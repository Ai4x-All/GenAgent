- `Image Rembg (Remove Background)`: The Image Rembg (Remove Background) node is designed to process images by removing the background, enhancing the focus on the foreground elements. It utilizes various image processing techniques such as thresholding, blurring, and masking to achieve a transparent or solid-color background, thereby isolating the main subjects of the image.
    - Parameters:
        - `transparency`: Controls the level of transparency applied to the background area of the images, allowing for fine-tuning of the background removal effect. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `model`: Specifies the model used for background removal, enabling the selection of different algorithms based on the desired outcome. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `post_processing`: Indicates whether post-processing steps such as smoothing and edge refinement are applied to the processed images. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `only_mask`: When set to true, the node outputs only the mask used for background removal instead of the processed images. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `alpha_matting`: Enables alpha matting, which helps in achieving more accurate and finer background removal, especially around the edges of the foreground elements. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `alpha_matting_foreground_threshold`: Sets the threshold for determining the foreground elements during the alpha matting process, affecting the precision of the background removal. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha_matting_background_threshold`: Sets the threshold for determining the background elements during the alpha matting process, affecting the precision of the background removal. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha_matting_erode_size`: Determines the size of the erosion applied to the mask during the alpha matting process, impacting the smoothness of the edges. Type should be `INT`.
        - `background_color`: Specifies the color applied to the background of the images after removal, allowing for customization of the background appearance. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The input images to be processed for background removal. These images undergo transformations to isolate the foreground from the background. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `images`: The output is a collection of images with the background removed. Each image in the collection has been processed to isolate the foreground elements. Type should be `IMAGE`.
