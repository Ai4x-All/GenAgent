- `GLIGENTextBoxApplyBatch`: The GLIGENTextBoxApplyBatch node is designed for batch processing of text box applications, enabling the efficient application of text overlays or modifications across multiple images or frames in a batch operation. This node streamlines the process of adding text to images, making it ideal for scenarios where consistent text elements need to be applied to a series of images, such as in video frames or a collection of related images.
    - Parameters:
        - `text`: The 'text' input allows for specifying the text content to be applied across the batch of images, serving as the primary content for text overlays or modifications. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `width`: This input defines the width of the text box overlay, allowing for customization of the overlay size relative to the images. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The 'height' input specifies the height of the text box overlay, enabling precise control over the overlay dimensions. Type should be `INT`.
        - `coordinates`: The 'coordinates' input provides the positioning information for the text box overlays, dictating where on the images the text will be applied. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `interpolation`: This input determines the interpolation method used for text box application, affecting the smoothness and blending of the text overlay on the images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `conditioning_to`: This input specifies the target conditioning data to which the text box modifications will be applied, serving as the foundation for the text overlay process. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latents`: The 'latents' input provides the latent representations of images in the batch, which are used as the basis for applying text box modifications. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `clip`: This input represents the CLIP model used for encoding text inputs, facilitating the generation of text-based features that are applied to the images. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `gligen_textbox_model`: The 'gligen_textbox_model' input specifies the model used for generating the text box overlays, enabling the customization and application of text to the images. Type should be `GLIGEN`.
    - Outputs:
        - `conditioning`: The output 'conditioning' reflects the modified conditioning data after the application of text box overlays, incorporating the text modifications into the conditioning framework. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `image`: The 'image' output showcases the final images with the applied text box overlays, demonstrating the visual modifications made to the batch of images. Type should be `IMAGE`.
