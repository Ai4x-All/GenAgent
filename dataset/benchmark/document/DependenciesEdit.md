- `DependenciesEdit`: The `DependenciesEdit` node is designed to modify and update the dependencies required for art generation processes. It allows for the customization of various components such as VAE models, checkpoints, CLIP models, and more, based on the provided inputs. This node plays a crucial role in tailoring the art generation pipeline to specific needs by adjusting the underlying dependencies.
    - Inputs:
        - `dependencies` (Required): A tuple containing the current set of dependencies, which this node will modify based on the other input parameters. It's the core input that determines the starting point for any modifications. Type should be `DEPENDENCIES`.
        - `ckpt_name` (Optional): Determines the checkpoint name for the model, enabling the selection from available checkpoints or specifying custom ones. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `vae_name` (Optional): Specifies the name of the VAE model to be used, allowing for the selection from predefined options or custom models. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `clip` (Optional): Defines the CLIP model to be utilized, offering flexibility in choosing the appropriate model for the task. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `clip_skip` (Optional): Sets the number of layers to skip in the CLIP model, optimizing performance or accuracy as needed. Type should be `INT`.
        - `positive` (Optional): A positive prompt to influence the generation process, enhancing the creative output. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `negative` (Optional): A negative prompt to steer away the generation from undesired directions, refining the results. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `lora_stack` (Optional): Specifies the LoRA stack to be applied, allowing for advanced model adaptation and fine-tuning. Type should be `LORA_STACK`.
        - `cnet_stack` (Optional): Determines the ControlNet stack to be used, enabling precise control over the generation process. Type should be `CONTROL_NET_STACK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `dependencies`: The modified set of dependencies, reflecting the updates made based on the input parameters. Type should be `DEPENDENCIES`.
