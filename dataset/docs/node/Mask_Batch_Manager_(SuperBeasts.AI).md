- `Mask Batch Manager (SuperBeasts.AI)`: The Mask Batch Manager (SuperBeasts.AI) node is designed for the efficient processing and management of mask batches in image manipulation tasks. It supports operations such as resizing, cropping, ordering, and concatenation of individual masks or mask batches, ensuring they conform to specified dimensions. This facilitates streamlined batch processing for various image processing workflows.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: Specifies the desired width of the output masks, affecting how individual masks are scaled and cropped to match this width. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Specifies the desired height of the output masks, influencing the scaling and cropping operations to ensure the output masks match this height. Type should be `INT`.
        - `ordering_enabled`: Enables or disables the ordering of input masks based on a specified order, allowing for custom arrangement of masks before processing. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `new_order`: Defines the new order for the input masks when ordering is enabled, determining the sequence in which masks are processed and concatenated. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `mask1`: An optional mask input. If provided, it is processed, resized, and included in the mask batch. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask2`: An optional mask input. If provided, it is processed, resized, and included in the mask batch. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask3`: An optional mask input. If provided, it is processed, resized, and included in the mask batch. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask4`: An optional mask input. If provided, it is processed, resized, and included in the mask batch. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask5`: An optional mask input. If provided, it is processed, resized, and included in the mask batch. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask6`: An optional mask input. If provided, it is processed, resized, and included in the mask batch. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask7`: An optional mask input. If provided, it is processed, resized, and included in the mask batch. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask8`: An optional mask input. If provided, it is processed, resized, and included in the mask batch. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask9`: An optional mask input. If provided, it is processed, resized, and included in the mask batch. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask10`: An optional mask input. If provided, it is processed, resized, and included in the mask batch. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask11`: An optional mask input. If provided, it is processed, resized, and included in the mask batch. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `mask12`: An optional mask input. If provided, it is processed, resized, and included in the mask batch. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The concatenated batch of processed masks, ready for further image processing tasks. Type should be `MASK`.
