- `Image Size to Number`: This node is designed to convert the dimensions of an image into numerical values, providing both integer and floating-point representations of the image's width and height.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image for which the width and height are to be determined and converted into numerical values. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `width_num`: The width of the image as a numerical value. Type should be `NUMBER`.
        - `height_num`: The height of the image as a numerical value. Type should be `NUMBER`.
        - `width_float`: The width of the image represented as a floating-point number. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `height_float`: The height of the image represented as a floating-point number. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `width_int`: The width of the image represented as an integer. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height_int`: The height of the image represented as an integer. Type should be `INT`.
