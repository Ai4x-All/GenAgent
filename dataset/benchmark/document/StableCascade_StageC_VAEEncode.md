- `StableCascade_StageC_VAEEncode`: This node is designed to encode images into a compressed latent representation using a VAE model, with an adjustable level of compression. It facilitates the transformation of visual data into a more compact form, enabling efficient processing and manipulation in latent space.
    - Inputs:
        - `image` (Required): The image to be encoded into latent space. It serves as the visual input that the node compresses into a latent representation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `vae` (Required): The VAE model used for encoding the image. It determines the method and quality of the compression into latent space. Type should be `VAE`.
        - `compression` (Required): The level of compression applied to the image before encoding. It affects the resolution of the output latent representation. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `stage_c`: The compressed latent representation of the image, specifically for stage C of the cascade process. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `stage_b`: A placeholder latent representation for stage B, initialized to zeros. Type should be `LATENT`.
