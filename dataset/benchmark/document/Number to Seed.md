- `Number to Seed`: This node converts a given number into a seed value, facilitating operations that require a seed for randomization or procedural generation.
    - Inputs:
        - `number` (Required): The number to be converted into a seed. This input is crucial as it directly determines the output seed value. Type should be `NUMBER`.
    - Outputs:
        - `seed`: The seed value derived from the input number. This output is significant for operations requiring a seed for randomization or procedural generation. Type should be `SEED`.
