- `FreeU`: The FreeU node is designed to enhance and modify the output of generative models by applying a Fourier filter to adjust the frequency components of the generated images. This process aims to improve image quality or introduce specific effects based on the scale and threshold parameters.
    - Parameters:
        - `b1`: A scale factor applied to the higher frequency components of the image, influencing the intensity of the adjustment. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `b2`: A scale factor applied to the lower frequency components of the image, influencing the intensity of the adjustment. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `s1`: A threshold parameter for the higher frequency components, determining the range of frequencies to be adjusted. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `s2`: A threshold parameter for the lower frequency components, determining the range of frequencies to be adjusted. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: The generative model to be enhanced or modified. This parameter is crucial as it determines the base model whose output will be adjusted by the FreeU node. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `model`: The modified generative model with an output block patched to apply the Fourier filter, enhancing or altering the generated images. Type should be `MODEL`.
