- `SaltScheduledPerlinPowerFractalNoise`: This node is designed to generate complex, visually appealing noise patterns by leveraging the Perlin noise algorithm. It intricately schedules and modifies Perlin noise parameters over time or across frames to produce dynamic, fractal-like visual effects that can be used in audio visualization or other graphical applications.
    - Parameters:
        - `batch_size`: Specifies the number of noise patterns to generate in a single batch, affecting the node's output volume and parallel processing efficiency. Type should be `INT`.
        - `width`: Determines the width of the generated noise pattern, directly influencing the spatial resolution and aspect ratio of the output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Sets the height of the generated noise pattern, impacting the spatial resolution and aspect ratio of the output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `device`: Specifies the computing device (CPU or GPU) on which the noise generation process is executed, affecting performance and efficiency. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `scale_schedule`: A schedule that adjusts the scale of the noise pattern across different frames or instances, allowing for dynamic changes in the visual complexity and detail of the noise. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `octaves_schedule`: Controls the number of octaves used in the noise generation process, affecting the level of detail and the overall complexity of the resulting pattern. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `persistence_schedule`: Adjusts the persistence parameter across frames, influencing the amplitude of the noise octaves and thereby the visual contrast of the pattern. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `lacunarity_schedule`: Modifies the lacunarity parameter over time, which affects the frequency of noise details and contributes to the fractal-like appearance of the output. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `exponent_schedule`: A schedule for the exponent parameter that influences the intensity and contrast of the noise pattern, allowing for nuanced adjustments to the visual output. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `seed_schedule`: Determines the seed values for noise generation, ensuring variability and uniqueness in the patterns produced across different instances or frames. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `clamp_min_schedule`: Sets the minimum clamp value for the noise output, enabling control over the lower bounds of the noise intensity and ensuring consistency in the pattern's visual range. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `clamp_max_schedule`: Defines the maximum clamp value for the noise output, allowing for control over the upper bounds of the noise intensity and ensuring consistency in the pattern's visual range. Type should be `LIST`.
    - Outputs:
        - `images`: The generated noise pattern as a tensor, ready for further processing or visualization. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `batch_size`: The number of noise patterns generated, corresponding to the input batch size. Type should be `INT`.
