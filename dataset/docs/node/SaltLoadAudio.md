- `SaltLoadAudio`: This node is designed to load audio files into the system, preparing them for further processing or analysis. It serves as the initial step in the audio handling pipeline, enabling subsequent nodes to manipulate or analyze the loaded audio data.
    - Parameters:
        - `file_path`: Specifies the path to the audio file to be loaded. It is essential for locating and accessing the audio data for processing. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `start_seconds`: Defines the starting point in seconds from which the audio will be loaded. This allows for partial loading of audio files, facilitating focused analysis or manipulation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `manual_bpm`: Allows for the manual specification of beats per minute (BPM), which can be used to override automatic BPM detection. This is useful for audio processing that relies on precise tempo information. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `frame_rate`: Sets the frame rate for the audio processing. This parameter influences the temporal resolution of the audio analysis and manipulation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `duration_seconds`: Determines the duration in seconds for which the audio will be loaded from the start point. This enables selective processing of audio segments. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `audio`: The loaded audio data, ready for further processing or analysis. Type should be `AUDIO`.
        - `bpm`: The detected or manually specified beats per minute (BPM) of the loaded audio. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `frame_rate`: The frame rate used during the audio loading process. Type should be `INT`.
        - `frame_count`: The total number of frames in the loaded audio segment, calculated based on the duration and frame rate. Type should be `INT`.
