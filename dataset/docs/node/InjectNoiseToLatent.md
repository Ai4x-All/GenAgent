- `InjectNoiseToLatent`: The InjectNoiseToLatent node is designed to modify latent representations by injecting noise into them. This process can include averaging the original and noise latents, scaling the noise by a strength factor, normalizing the noised latent, applying a mask to selectively noise parts of the latent, and optionally mixing in random noise. The node aims to enhance or alter the characteristics of the latent space for various generative tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `strength`: A factor that scales the injected noise, controlling the intensity of the noise effect on the latents. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `normalize`: A boolean flag indicating whether to normalize the noised latent, affecting its distribution. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `average`: Determines if the noise should be averaged with the original latents, offering a method to blend rather than solely add noise. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `mix_randn_amount`: The amount of random noise to mix into the noised latent, further introducing randomness. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `seed`: An optional seed for random number generation, ensuring reproducibility when mixing random noise. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `latents`: The original latent representations to which noise will be added. It serves as the base for noise injection, influencing the final output by its initial characteristics. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `noise`: The noise tensor to be injected into the latents, providing the variability or perturbation. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `mask`: An optional mask to apply selective noise injection, allowing for targeted alterations of the latent space. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The modified latent representations after noise injection, reflecting the combined effects of the input parameters. Type should be `LATENT`.
