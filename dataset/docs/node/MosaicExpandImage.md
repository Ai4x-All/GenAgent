- `MosaicExpandImage`: The MosaicExpandImage node is designed to expand an image by adding mosaic borders around it. These borders are created by cropping sections from the original image, generating a mosaic from these sections, and then pasting these mosaics around the original image to achieve the desired expanded size.
    - Parameters:
        - `left`: The number of mosaic strips to add to the left side of the image, determining the width of the left expansion. Type should be `INT`.
        - `top`: The number of mosaic strips to add to the top of the image, determining the height of the top expansion. Type should be `INT`.
        - `right`: The number of mosaic strips to add to the right side of the image, determining the width of the right expansion. Type should be `INT`.
        - `bottom`: The number of mosaic strips to add to the bottom of the image, determining the height of the bottom expansion. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The original image to be expanded. It serves as the central piece around which the mosaic borders are created and added. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `result_img`: The expanded image with mosaic borders added around the original image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
