- `CM_NumberBinaryCondition`: This node performs binary conditional operations on numbers, evaluating the relationship between two numeric inputs based on a specified condition.
    - Inputs:
        - `op` (Required): Specifies the binary conditional operation to be performed, determining how the two numbers are compared. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `a` (Required): The first number to be compared in the conditional operation. Type should be `NUMBER`.
        - `b` (Required): The second number to be compared in the conditional operation. Type should be `NUMBER`.
    - Outputs:
        - `bool`: The result of the binary conditional operation, indicating whether the specified condition holds true between the two numbers. Type should be `BOOL`.
