- `BatchAlign`: The `BatchAlign` node is designed to align multiple batches of data, ensuring consistency and uniformity across different sets of inputs. It focuses on adjusting the alignment of data batches to facilitate more coherent processing or analysis downstream.
    - Inputs:
        - `images` (Required): The images to be aligned, typically involving multiple frames or batches that require alignment for further processing. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `ref_frame` (Required): A reference frame or image against which other images are aligned. This serves as the baseline for alignment adjustments. Type should be `INT`.
        - `direction` (Required): Specifies the direction of alignment, potentially influencing how images are adjusted relative to the reference frame. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `blur` (Required): Determines the level of blur applied during the alignment process, affecting the smoothness or sharpness of the aligned images. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `aligned`: The result of aligning the input images, producing a coherent set of images aligned with the reference frame. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `flow`: A flow field or map indicating the transformation applied to each image for alignment, useful for understanding the alignment process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
