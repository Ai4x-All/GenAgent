- `KSamplerSeq`: The KSamplerSeq node is designed for advanced sampling in generative models, specifically focusing on the iterative refinement of latent images through a sequence of steps. It incorporates mechanisms for unsampling latents, adjusting denoise levels dynamically, and optionally looping through the sequence to enhance the quality or diversity of the generated samples.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: Determines the initial random seed for sampling, affecting the randomness and reproducibility of the generated samples. Type should be `INT`.
        - `seed_mode_seq`: Defines the mode of seed progression throughout the sequence, allowing for incremental, decremental, random, or fixed seed values. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `alternate_values`: Enables or disables the alternation of certain parameters between iterations to introduce variability. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `steps`: The total number of steps to execute in the sampling process, impacting the refinement and detail of the output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Controls the conditioning factor, influencing the adherence of the generated samples to the specified conditions. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Selects the specific sampling algorithm to be used, from a predefined set of samplers. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Chooses the scheduling algorithm for controlling the sampling process, affecting the progression of denoising and refinement. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `sequence_loop_count`: Determines how many times the sampling sequence is looped, potentially enhancing the output through repeated refinement. Type should be `INT`.
        - `use_conditioning_slerp`: Enables or disables spherical linear interpolation (slerp) for blending conditioning vectors, affecting the smoothness of transitions between conditions. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `cond_slerp_strength`: Controls the strength of the conditioning slerp, adjusting the influence of interpolated conditions on the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `use_latent_interpolation`: Enables or disables the interpolation of latent images, affecting the diversity and smoothness of transitions in the output. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `latent_interpolation_mode`: Selects the mode of latent image interpolation, allowing for blend, slerp, or cosine interpolation methods. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `latent_interp_strength`: Determines the strength of the latent image interpolation, influencing the degree of blending or transition between latent images. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `denoise_start`: Sets the initial denoise level, affecting the clarity and detail of the generated samples at the start of the sequence. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `denoise_seq`: Specifies the denoise level for subsequent iterations in the sequence, allowing for dynamic adjustment of clarity and detail. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `unsample_latents`: Determines whether to perform unsampling on the latents, potentially enhancing the quality or diversity of the output. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: Specifies the generative model to be used for sampling. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `positive_seq`: Specifies the positive conditioning sequence, guiding the generative model towards desired attributes in the output. Type should be `CONDITIONING_SEQ`.
        - `negative_seq`: Specifies the negative conditioning sequence, steering the generative model away from undesired attributes in the output. Type should be `CONDITIONING_SEQ`.
        - `latent_image`: Provides the initial latent image to be refined through the sampling process. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The latent representation of the generated samples, indicating the underlying data structure that defines the output images. Type should be `LATENT`.
