- `LDSRUpscale`: The LDSRUpscale node is designed to upscale images using a specified model, with options for pre and post downscaling, and a choice of downsample methods. It allows for detailed control over the upscaling process, including the number of steps and downscale factors, to enhance image resolution effectively.
    - Parameters:
        - `steps`: Defines the number of steps to be used in the upscaling process, affecting the detail and quality of the output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `pre_downscale`: Optional pre-processing step to downscale images before upscaling, which can affect the upscaling quality and performance. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `post_downscale`: Optional post-processing step to adjust the size of the upscaled images, allowing for size customization or restoration to original dimensions. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `downsample_method`: The method used for downsampling during pre and post downscale steps, influencing the quality of the downscaled images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `upscale_model`: Specifies the model to be used for upscaling the images. This choice determines the upscaling technique and quality. Type should be `UPSCALE_MODEL`.
        - `images`: A collection of images to be upscaled. This input allows the node to process multiple images in a single operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `images`: The upscaled images, enhanced in resolution and detail through the specified upscaling process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
