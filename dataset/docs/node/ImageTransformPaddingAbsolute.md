        - `method`: The method used to fill the added padding area, with options including 'reflect', 'edge', and 'constant'. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The batch of images to which padding will be applied. This is the primary input for the transformation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The batch of images after padding has been applied, with increased dimensions according to the specified add_width and add_height. Type should be `IMAGE`.
