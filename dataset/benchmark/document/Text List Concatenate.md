- `Text List Concatenate`: The node is designed to concatenate multiple lists into a single list. It processes optional lists provided as inputs and merges them in a sorted order, creating a unified list that combines all elements.
    - Inputs:
        - `list_a` (Optional): Represents the first optional list to be concatenated. It plays a role in the overall merging process by contributing its elements to the final merged list. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `list_b` (Optional): Represents the second optional list to be concatenated. It contributes its elements to the final merged list, enhancing the overall content. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `list_c` (Optional): Represents the third optional list to be concatenated. Its elements are added to the final merged list, enriching the combined output. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `list_d` (Optional): Represents the fourth optional list to be concatenated. It adds its elements to the final merged list, completing the aggregation of content. Type should be `LIST`.
    - Outputs:
        - `list`: The output is a single list that contains all elements from the input lists, merged in a sorted order. Type should be `LIST`.
