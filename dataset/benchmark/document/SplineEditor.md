- `SplineEditor`: The SplineEditor node is a graphical tool designed for creating and editing splines that represent various schedules or mask batches. It provides a user-friendly interface for manipulating control points and curves, enabling the customization of values for different applications. This node is particularly useful for tasks that require precise control over the interpolation and distribution of values across a specified domain, such as animation scheduling or data visualization.
    - Inputs:
        - `points_store` (Required): A storage mechanism for the control points. It plays a critical role in managing and accessing the points for spline generation and manipulation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `coordinates` (Required): A list of coordinates for control points. These points define the shape and trajectory of the spline, directly impacting its form and the interpolated values. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `mask_width` (Required): Specifies the width of the mask to be generated. It determines the horizontal dimension of the output mask or batch, affecting the resolution and scale of the generated spline. Type should be `INT`.
        - `mask_height` (Required): Defines the height of the mask to be generated. It influences the vertical dimension of the output, playing a crucial role in determining the resolution and scale of the spline. Type should be `INT`.
        - `points_to_sample` (Required): Sets the number of sample points to be generated from the spline. This value determines the granularity of the output, impacting the precision and detail of the interpolated values. Type should be `INT`.
        - `sampling_method` (Required): Chooses the method for sampling points along the spline, either by time or path. This affects how values are distributed along the spline, catering to different use cases like schedules or coordinates. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `interpolation` (Required): Specifies the method of interpolation between control points. This choice influences the smoothness and curvature of the spline, affecting its overall appearance and functionality. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `tension` (Required): Controls the tension of the spline curve. Adjusting this parameter affects the curvature and tightness of the spline, allowing for finer control over its shape. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `repeat_output` (Required): Determines whether the output should be repeated. This can be useful for creating looping animations or patterns that require a continuous sequence of values. Type should be `INT`.
        - `float_output_type` (Required): Determines the type of float values to be outputted, affecting the format and usability of the generated data for subsequent nodes or processes. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `min_value` (Optional): Sets the minimum value for the output range. This parameter ensures that the generated values do not fall below a certain threshold, maintaining consistency and control over the output. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `max_value` (Optional): Establishes the maximum value for the output range. It caps the generated values to prevent them from exceeding a specified limit, ensuring the output remains within desired parameters. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: Generates a batch of masks based on the defined spline. This output is suitable for nodes that require mask inputs for further processing. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `coord_str`: Produces a list of float values interpolated from the spline. These values can be used for weight adjustments or other numerical applications. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `float`: Outputs a pandas series containing values derived from the spline. This format is convenient for data analysis and manipulation within pandas-supported environments. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `count`: Creates a torch tensor from the spline's interpolated values. This output is compatible with PyTorch-based models and operations, facilitating integration into deep learning workflows. Type should be `INT`.
        - `normalized_str`: Provides a normalized string representation of the spline's interpolated values, useful for textual descriptions or further string-based processing. Type should be `STRING`.
