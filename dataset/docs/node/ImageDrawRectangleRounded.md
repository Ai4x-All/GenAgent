- `ImageDrawRectangleRounded`: This node is designed to draw rounded rectangles on images. It allows for detailed customization of the rectangle's appearance, including its size, border color, fill color, and corner radii, enabling the creation of visually appealing graphics with rounded corners.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: The width of the canvas on which the rounded rectangle will be drawn. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The height of the canvas on which the rounded rectangle will be drawn. Type should be `INT`.
        - `start_x`: The x-coordinate of the rectangle's starting point, defining the rectangle's position along the x-axis. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `start_y`: The y-coordinate of the rectangle's starting point, defining the rectangle's position along the y-axis. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_x`: The x-coordinate of the rectangle's end point, determining the width of the rectangle. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `end_y`: The y-coordinate of the rectangle's end point, determining the height of the rectangle. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `radius`: The radius of the corners, specifying how rounded the corners should be. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_size`: The thickness of the rectangle's outline, allowing for the customization of the border's appearance. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_red`: The red component of the outline's color, contributing to the overall color of the rectangle's border. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_green`: The green component of the outline's color, contributing to the overall color of the rectangle's border. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_blue`: The blue component of the outline's color, contributing to the overall color of the rectangle's border. Type should be `INT`.
        - `outline_alpha`: The alpha (transparency) value of the outline, allowing for the adjustment of the border's opacity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `fill_red`: The red component of the rectangle's fill color, determining the primary color inside the rectangle. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_green`: The green component of the rectangle's fill color, determining the primary color inside the rectangle. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_blue`: The blue component of the rectangle's fill color, determining the primary color inside the rectangle. Type should be `INT`.
        - `fill_alpha`: The alpha (transparency) value of the fill, allowing for the adjustment of the rectangle's interior opacity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `top_left_corner`: A flag indicating whether the top left corner should be rounded. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `top_right_corner`: A flag indicating whether the top right corner should be rounded. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `bottom_right_corner`: A flag indicating whether the bottom right corner should be rounded. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `bottom_left_corner`: A flag indicating whether the bottom left corner should be rounded. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `SSAA`: Super Sample Anti-Aliasing factor to improve the drawing's quality by reducing aliasing effects. Type should be `INT`.
        - `method`: The method used for resizing the image, affecting the quality of the final output. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output image with the drawn rounded rectangle, showcasing the applied customizations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
