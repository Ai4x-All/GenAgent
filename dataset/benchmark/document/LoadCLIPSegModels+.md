- `LoadCLIPSegModels+`: This node is designed to load the CLIPSeg models for image segmentation, specifically initializing and returning the CLIPSeg processor and model pre-trained on a specific dataset. It abstracts the complexity of model loading, providing an easy-to-use interface for obtaining the necessary components for CLIPSeg-based segmentation tasks.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `clip_seg`: The output is a tuple containing the CLIPSeg processor and model, ready for use in image segmentation tasks. Type should be `CLIP_SEG`.
