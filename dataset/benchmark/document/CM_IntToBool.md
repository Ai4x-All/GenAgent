- `CM_IntToBool`: The node transforms an integer input into a boolean output, effectively converting numerical values into binary conditions based on their equivalence to zero.
    - Inputs:
        - `a` (Required): The integer input to be converted into a boolean. If the input is non-zero, the output is True; otherwise, it is False. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `bool`: The boolean result of the conversion, indicating whether the input integer was non-zero. Type should be `BOOL`.
