- `ImageEffectsLensOpticAxis`: This node applies a lens optic axis effect to images, manipulating their appearance based on parameters like lens shape, edge, curvy, zoom, brightness, and saturation. It creates a mask to selectively apply transformations, simulating the optical axis effect of a lens on the input images.
    - Parameters:
        - `lens_shape`: Defines the shape of the lens effect applied to the images, influencing the overall appearance of the optic axis effect. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lens_edge`: Specifies the edge behavior of the lens effect, determining how the effect fades or transitions at the boundaries of the images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `lens_curvy`: Adjusts the curvature of the lens effect, allowing for customization of the optic axis effect's intensity and shape. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `lens_zoom`: Controls the zoom level of the lens effect, affecting the scale and intensity of the optic axis effect on the images. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `lens_aperture`: Determines the aperture size of the lens effect, influencing the depth of field and focus area in the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `blur_intensity`: Sets the intensity of the blur effect applied alongside the lens optic axis effect, contributing to the overall visual simulation of a camera lens. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The input images to which the lens optic axis effect will be applied. This parameter is crucial as it serves as the base for the effect application. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The images after the application of the lens optic axis effect, showcasing the transformed appearance. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: The mask used to apply the lens optic axis effect, indicating the areas of the images affected by the transformation. Type should be `MASK`.
