- `Batch Transform (mtb)`: This node is designed to apply a series of 2D transformations to batches of images, including operations such as translation, rotation, and scaling. It abstracts complex image manipulation processes into a more accessible interface for batch processing, enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of image transformation tasks.
    - Parameters:
        - `border_handling`: Specifies the method for handling borders during the transformation process, affecting how the image is extended or cropped. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image tensor to be transformed, serving as the primary data upon which the batch transformations are applied. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `constant_color`: Defines the color used to fill any new areas of the image created as a result of the transformation, ensuring visual consistency. Type should be `COLOR`.
        - `x`: Optional list of floats representing the translation distances along the x-axis for each image in the batch. Type should be `FLOATS`.
        - `y`: Optional list of floats representing the translation distances along the y-axis for each image in the batch. Type should be `FLOATS`.
        - `zoom`: Optional list of floats indicating the zoom levels to be applied to each image in the batch. Type should be `FLOATS`.
        - `angle`: Optional list of floats specifying the rotation angles for each image in the batch, in degrees. Type should be `FLOATS`.
        - `shear`: Optional list of floats detailing the shear angles to be applied to each image in the batch, adding a skew effect. Type should be `FLOATS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The transformed image tensor, resulting from the applied batch of 2D transformations. Type should be `IMAGE`.
