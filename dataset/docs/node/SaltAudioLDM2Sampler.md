- `SaltAudioLDM2Sampler`: The SaltAudioLDM2Sampler node utilizes the AudioLDM2 model for generating audio waveforms based on given prompts, offering control over the generation process through parameters like seed, steps, and guidance scale. It's tailored for creating audio content with specific characteristics defined by positive and negative prompts.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: Determines the randomness seed for audio generation, enabling reproducible outputs. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Defines the number of steps to be taken in the audio generation process, impacting the detail and quality of the output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `guidance_scale`: Controls the influence of the prompts on the generated audio, with higher values leading to more prompt-conforming outputs. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `audio_length_seconds`: Sets the length of the generated audio in seconds, allowing for customization of the output duration. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `num_waveforms`: Determines the number of audio waveforms to generate, enabling multiple outputs from a single prompt. Type should be `INT`.
        - `positive_prompt`: The positive prompt guides the audio generation towards desired characteristics or themes. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `negative_prompt`: The negative prompt steers the audio generation away from certain characteristics or themes, refining the output. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `audioldm2_model`: Specifies the AudioLDM2 model to be used for audio generation, affecting the quality and style of the output audio. Type should be `AUDIOLDM_MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `audio`: The generated audio waveform as a result of the sampling process, based on the provided prompts and parameters. Type should be `AUDIO`.
