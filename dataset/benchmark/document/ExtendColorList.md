- `ExtendColorList`: The ExtendColorList node is designed to augment an existing list of colors by adding more color values to it. This functionality is essential in scenarios where a dynamic expansion of color selections is required, such as in image processing, design applications, or data visualization tasks, where a broader palette may enhance the output's aesthetic or informational value.
    - Inputs:
        - `inputs_len` (Required): Specifies the number of color values to be added to the existing color list. This parameter determines the size of the expansion of the color palette. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `color`: The augmented list of colors, combining the original color list with the newly added color values. This output is significant for subsequent use in applications requiring a broader or modified color palette. Type should be `COLOR`.
