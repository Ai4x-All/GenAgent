- `Color Clip (advanced)`: This node specializes in adjusting the colors within an image based on a set of advanced criteria, including the ability to target specific colors for transformation or to apply complementary color adjustments. It extends basic color clipping functionalities by allowing for more nuanced control over color manipulation, enabling the creation of highly customized visual effects.
    - Parameters:
        - `target`: Specifies the desired color transformation for the targeted areas of the image. It defines how the reference color areas should be altered. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `complement`: Determines the color transformation for areas of the image not matching the reference color. It allows for differential treatment of image regions based on color matching. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The image to be processed for color clipping. It serves as the primary input on which color transformations are applied, determining the visual outcome of the operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `color`: The reference color that guides the clipping operation. It is used to identify which parts of the image should be targeted for color transformation. Type should be `COLOR`.
        - `color_a`: An optional color parameter that provides an additional color option for transformation. It offers further customization for the clipping operation. Type should be `COLOR`.
        - `color_b`: Another optional color parameter that provides an alternative color option for transformation, enhancing the flexibility of the color clipping process. Type should be `COLOR`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting image after the color clipping operation. It reflects the applied color transformations, showcasing the visual effects achieved through the process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
