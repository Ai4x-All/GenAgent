- `ImageSharpen`: The ImageSharpen node enhances the clarity of an image by applying a sharpening filter. This process accentuates the edges and details within the image, making it appear more defined and crisp.
    - Inputs:
        - `image` (Required): The input image to be sharpened. This tensor represents the image data that will undergo the sharpening process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `sharpen_radius` (Required): Defines the radius of the sharpening effect. A larger radius increases the area of influence around edges, enhancing the sharpening effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `sigma` (Required): Determines the spread of the Gaussian kernel used in the sharpening process. A higher sigma value results in a smoother, less localized sharpening effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `alpha` (Required): Controls the intensity of the sharpening. Higher alpha values result in a more pronounced sharpening effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The sharpened image. This output is the result of applying the sharpening filter to the input image, enhancing its edges and details. Type should be `IMAGE`.
