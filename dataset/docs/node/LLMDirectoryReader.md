- `LLMDirectoryReader`: The LLMDirectoryReader node is designed to read and process directories, efficiently handling and organizing the contents into a structured format suitable for further analysis or processing. It abstracts the complexity of directory traversal and content extraction, making it easier to work with large sets of files or nested directory structures.
    - Parameters:
        - `input_directory`: Specifies the path to the directory to be read, serving as the starting point for the node's directory traversal and content extraction operations. This parameter is essential for defining the scope of the reading process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `recursive`: A boolean flag that determines whether the reading operation should recursively traverse subdirectories. Enabling this can significantly affect the depth and comprehensiveness of the directory reading process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `required_ext_list`: Defines a list of file extensions to include in the reading process. This filters the files to be processed, directly influencing the node's output by limiting it to files of specified types. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `exclude_glob_list`: Specifies patterns to exclude from the reading process. This can prevent certain files or directories from being processed, tailoring the output to exclude irrelevant or sensitive information. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `optional_path_list`: A list of specific paths within the directory to focus on. This can refine the reading process to target particular files or subdirectories, potentially optimizing performance and relevance of the output. Type should be `*`.
    - Outputs:
        - `documents`: Returns a structured representation of the contents read from the directory, typically organized in a way that facilitates further analysis or processing. Type should be `DOCUMENT`.
