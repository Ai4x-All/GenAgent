- `FlipSigmasAdjusted`: The FlipSigmasAdjusted node is designed to manipulate a sequence of sigma values for use in diffusion models. It inverts the order of the sigma values, applies an offset, and optionally scales the sequence based on the last sigma value or a specified divisor. This node is useful for adjusting the noise levels applied during the denoising steps of a generative model's sampling process.
    - Parameters:
        - `divide_by_last_sigma`: A boolean flag that determines whether the adjusted sigma values should be scaled by the last sigma value in the sequence. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `divide_by`: A scalar value by which the adjusted sigma values are divided, providing a means to scale the sequence. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `offset_by`: An integer value indicating how much to offset the sigma values in the sequence, allowing for further adjustment. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `sigmas`: The sequence of sigma values to be adjusted. The inversion and adjustment operations are applied to this sequence. Type should be `SIGMAS`.
    - Outputs:
        - `SIGMAS`: The adjusted sequence of sigma values after inversion, offsetting, and optional scaling. Type should be `SIGMAS`.
        - `sigmas_string`: A string representation of the adjusted sigma values, formatted for easy readability. Type should be `STRING`.
