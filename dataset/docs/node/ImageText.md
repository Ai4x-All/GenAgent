- `ImageText`: The ImageText node is designed for rendering text onto an image canvas, supporting customization of font, size, color, alignment, and margins. It allows for the creation of text-based images with specified styling and layout, including the option for outlined text.
    - Parameters:
        - `text`: The text to be rendered on the image. It defines the content of the image and is central to the node's operation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `font`: Specifies the font style to be used for the text, influencing the visual appearance of the rendered text. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `size`: The font size for the text, which determines the scale of the text relative to the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `red`: The red color component of the text, part of the RGBA color model used to define the text color. Type should be `INT`.
        - `green`: The green color component of the text, contributing to the RGBA color model for text color definition. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blue`: The blue color component of the text, completing the RGB part of the text's color specification. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha`: The alpha (transparency) component of the text and outline color, allowing for opacity adjustments. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `margin_x`: The horizontal margin size, affecting the text's positioning from the left and right edges of the image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `margin_y`: The vertical margin size, influencing the text's positioning from the top and bottom edges of the image. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is an image tensor with the rendered text, ready for further processing or display. Type should be `IMAGE`.
