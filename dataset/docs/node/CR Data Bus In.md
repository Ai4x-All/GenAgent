- `CR Data Bus In`: The CR Data Bus In node is designed for loading and initializing data into a pipeline, allowing for optional inputs to be provided and utilized within the data flow. It serves as an entry point for data, facilitating the integration and manipulation of various data types as they enter the system.
    - Parameters:
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Represents the primary data conduit into which data is loaded. It can optionally accept a tuple of any types, enabling the flexible integration of data into the pipeline. Type should be `*`.
        - `any1`: An optional input parameter that can be used to provide additional data or override the first element of the 'pipe' tuple if both are provided. Type should be `*`.
        - `any2`: Similar to 'any1', this optional input parameter allows for the provision or overriding of the second element in the 'pipe' tuple. Type should be `*`.
        - `any3`: This optional parameter enables the provision or overriding of the third element in the 'pipe' tuple, allowing for further customization of the data flow. Type should be `*`.
        - `any4`: Allows for the provision or overriding of the fourth element in the 'pipe' tuple, facilitating additional flexibility in how data is integrated into the pipeline. Type should be `*`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: Outputs a tuple representing the loaded data, potentially modified by the optional input parameters. This tuple serves as the processed data ready for further manipulation or analysis in subsequent nodes. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `show_help`: Provides a URL to the documentation or help page for this node, offering users guidance and additional information on its usage. Type should be `STRING`.
