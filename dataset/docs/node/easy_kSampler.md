- `easy kSampler`: The easy kSampler node is designed to facilitate complex sampling processes by abstracting the intricacies of various sampling and scheduling algorithms. It integrates a range of samplers and schedulers, allowing for flexible and advanced image generation and manipulation through conditioning, denoising, and latent space exploration.
    - Parameters:
        - `image_output`: Determines the output format and characteristics of the generated image, influencing the visual quality and aspects of the final product. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `link_id`: A unique identifier used to link the sampling process with other processes or outputs, facilitating integration and traceability. Type should be `INT`.
        - `save_prefix`: Defines a prefix for saving the generated images, aiding in the organization and retrieval of output files. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `pipe`: Specifies the pipeline configuration for the sampling process, central to orchestrating the flow and execution of tasks. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `model`: Specifies the model to be used for sampling, central to determining the behavior and output of the sampling process. Type should be `MODEL`.
    - Outputs:
        - `pipe`: The output pipeline configuration after the sampling process, reflecting any changes or adjustments made during execution. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `image`: The generated image resulting from the sampling process, ready for further use or analysis. Type should be `IMAGE`.
