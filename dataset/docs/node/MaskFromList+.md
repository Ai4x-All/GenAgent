- `MaskFromList+`: The `MaskFromList` node is designed for creating masks from a list of values, allowing for the specification of mask dimensions through width and height parameters. This functionality is essential for generating custom masks tailored to specific dimensions, facilitating various image processing tasks such as segmentation and conditioning.
    - Parameters:
        - `values`: The `values` parameter is a list of floating-point numbers representing the intensity values for the mask. These values are crucial for defining the mask's appearance, with each value corresponding to a pixel's intensity in the mask. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `width`: The `width` parameter specifies the width of the mask to be generated. It determines the horizontal dimension of the mask, playing a critical role in shaping the mask's size and aspect ratio. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: The `height` parameter defines the height of the mask to be generated. It determines the vertical dimension of the mask, affecting the mask's size and aspect ratio. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `mask`: The output `mask` parameter is the generated mask based on the provided values and dimensions. It represents the custom mask created to meet the specified width and height, suitable for various image processing applications. Type should be `MASK`.
