- `LLMParquetDatasetSearcher`: This node is designed to perform advanced search operations within large datasets stored in Parquet format. It leverages language models to interpret and execute complex queries, applying filters, relevancy scoring, and parallel processing to efficiently retrieve and rank results based on the query's intent.
    - Parameters:
        - `file_type`: Specifies the type of file to be searched, such as parquet, text, json, yaml, csv, or excel, determining the method of data extraction and processing. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `path_or_url`: The location of the file to be searched, either as a local file path or a URL, providing access to the dataset for the search operation. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `search_term`: The query or keywords to search for within the dataset, guiding the search and filtering process. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `exclude_terms`: Terms to be excluded from the search results, allowing for more refined and relevant outcomes. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `columns`: Specific columns within the dataset to search, enabling targeted searches and improving efficiency. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `case_sensitive`: Determines whether the search should be case sensitive, affecting the matching process. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `max_results`: The maximum number of search results to return, controlling the scope of the search output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `term_relevancy_threshold`: A threshold for relevancy scoring, filtering results based on their relevance to the search term. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `use_relevancy`: Indicates whether relevancy scoring should be applied to the search results, enhancing result quality. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `min_length`: The minimum length of the search results, filtering out results that do not meet this criterion. Type should be `INT`.
        - `max_length`: The maximum length of the search results, ensuring that results are within a specified size range. Type should be `INT`.
        - `max_dynamic_retries`: The number of times the search should be retried with dynamic adjustments in case of no results, improving the chances of finding relevant data. Type should be `INT`.
        - `clean_content`: Specifies whether the content should be cleaned or pre-processed before searching, affecting the accuracy of the results. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `excel_sheet_position`: For excel files, specifies the sheet to be searched, allowing for targeted data extraction within multi-sheet documents. Type should be `INT`.
        - `recache`: Determines whether the data should be recached, potentially improving performance for repeated searches. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `condense_documents`: Indicates whether the search results should be condensed, potentially reducing the volume of data returned. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `seed`: A seed value for random operations within the search, ensuring reproducibility of results. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `results`: The primary output containing the search results, including relevant data entries. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `results_list`: A list format of the search results, providing an alternative representation. Type should be `LIST`.
        - `documents`: Structured documents derived from the search results, potentially including metadata and additional context. Type should be `DOCUMENT`.
