- `Prompt With Style V2`: This node processes textual prompts by applying a specified style, removing any style syntax, and handling positive and negative prompts differently based on the style. It also incorporates seed-based modifications to ensure variability in the output.
    - Parameters:
        - `positive_prompt`: The positive prompt to be styled and modified. It undergoes transformations based on the specified style and seed, contributing to the generation of the styled output. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `negative_prompt`: The negative prompt to be styled and modified similarly to the positive prompt, but with potentially different style applications based on the specified style. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `style`: The style to be applied to the prompts. It determines how the prompts are modified and styled, playing a crucial role in the output generation process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `ratio_selected`: The selected ratio for image generation, affecting the dimensions of the output images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `batch_size`: The number of prompts to process in a single batch, affecting performance and output volume. Type should be `INT`.
        - `seed`: A seed value used to introduce variability and randomness in the processing of prompts, affecting how wildcards and random syntax are handled. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip_base`: The base CLIP model used for encoding the prompts. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `clip_refiner`: The CLIP refiner model used for refining the encoded prompts. Type should be `CLIP`.
    - Outputs:
        - `samples`: The generated samples based on the processed prompts and applied styles. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `base_pos_cond`: The positive condition base encoding result from the CLIP model. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `base_neg_cond`: The negative condition base encoding result from the CLIP model. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `refiner_pos_cond`: The positive condition refiner encoding result from the CLIP refiner model. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `refiner_neg_cond`: The negative condition refiner encoding result from the CLIP refiner model. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `positive_prompt`: The processed positive prompt with the applied style, stripped of any style syntax. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `negative_prompt`: The processed negative prompt with the applied style, stripped of any style syntax. Type should be `STRING`.
