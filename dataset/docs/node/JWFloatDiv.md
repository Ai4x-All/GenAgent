- `JWFloatDiv`: The JWFloatDiv node performs division between two float values, returning the result as a float. This operation allows for the dynamic computation of ratios or adjustments based on floating-point numbers.
    - Parameters:
        - `a`: The 'a' parameter represents the dividend in the division operation. It's a crucial component as it determines the base value from which the division starts. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `b`: The 'b' parameter acts as the divisor in the division operation. Its value directly influences the result, making it essential for calculating the division outcome. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `float`: The output is the result of dividing the 'a' parameter by the 'b' parameter. It represents the quotient in float format. Type should be `FLOAT`.
