- `ImageContainerInheritanceMax`: The ImageContainerInheritanceMax node is designed to manage image data by applying a 'maximum' operation across multiple images. This node abstracts the complexity of handling image dimensions and pixel values, facilitating the creation of composite images where the maximum value of each pixel across all images is considered.
    - Parameters:
        - `red`: Specifies the red color component for the operation's background or effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `green`: Specifies the green color component for the operation's background or effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `blue`: Specifies the blue color component for the operation's background or effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha`: Defines the alpha (transparency) level for the operation's background or effect. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `method`: Determines the method of applying the 'maximum' operation across the images. The 'single' option applies the operation to create a single composite image, 'for_each_pair' generates a new image for each pair of input images, and 'for_each_matrix' creates a composite image for each possible combination of images from 'images_a' and 'images_b', significantly affecting the node's execution and results. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images_a`: The 'images_a' input type accepts a collection of images to be processed, serving as one of the sets of images for the operation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `images_b`: The 'images_b' input type accepts a second collection of images, working in conjunction with 'images_a' to determine the operation's scope. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is a single image that represents the composite result of applying the 'maximum' operation across all input images. It encapsulates the highest pixel values from the input set for each pixel position. Type should be `IMAGE`.
