- `CR Pipe Switch`: The CR Pipe Switch node is designed to dynamically select between two pipeline paths based on a specified input. It facilitates conditional execution within a pipeline, allowing for more flexible and customizable data processing flows.
    - Inputs:
        - `Input` (Required): Determines which pipeline path to select for execution. A value of 1 selects the first pipeline, while any other value selects the second pipeline. Type should be `INT`.
        - `pipe1` (Required): The first pipeline path to be potentially executed. It is selected if the 'Input' parameter is set to 1. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `pipe2` (Required): The second pipeline path to be potentially executed. It is selected if the 'Input' parameter is not set to 1. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `PIPE_LINE`: The selected pipeline path based on the 'Input' parameter. Type should be `PIPE_LINE`.
        - `show_help`: A URL providing additional information and documentation about the CR Pipe Switch node. Type should be `STRING`.
