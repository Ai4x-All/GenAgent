- `SaltKeyframeScheduler`: The SaltKeyframeScheduler node is designed for generating a schedule based on keyframes, applying easing functions to interpolate between these keyframes over time. It allows for the customization of the schedule through various parameters, including the selection of easing modes and the adjustment of frame rates, to create dynamic and smooth transitions in animations or visualizations.
    - Inputs:
        - `keyframe_schedule` (Required): Defines the sequence of keyframes to be scheduled. Each keyframe represents a significant point in the animation or visualization that the schedule aims to reach, serving as the foundation for the generated schedule. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `easing_mode` (Required): Specifies the easing function to be applied between keyframes, determining the interpolation method and thus affecting the smoothness and dynamics of the transition. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `end_frame` (Optional): The last frame to be considered in the schedule, allowing for the specification of a custom range within the keyframe sequence. Type should be `INT`.
        - `ndigits` (Optional): Determines the precision of the computed values in the schedule, affecting the granularity of the interpolation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `a` (Optional): Custom variable 'a' that can be used for additional control over the scheduling, providing flexibility in the scheduling logic. Type should be `*`.
        - `b` (Optional): Custom variable 'b', similar to 'a', offers further customization options for the scheduling process, enhancing the node's versatility. Type should be `*`.
    - Outputs:
        - `schedule_list`: The resulting list of scheduled values, interpolated according to the specified easing mode and other parameters, ready for use in animations or visualizations. Type should be `LIST`.
