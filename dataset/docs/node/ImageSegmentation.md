- `ImageSegmentation`: The ImageSegmentation node specializes in segmenting images into distinct regions, separating foreground from background. It utilizes advanced models and techniques such as alpha matting to refine the segmentation edges, offering precise and customizable image segmentation capabilities.
    - Parameters:
        - `model`: Specifies the segmentation model to use, affecting the accuracy and style of the segmentation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `alpha_matting`: A boolean flag indicating whether alpha matting should be applied to improve the segmentation edges by making them more precise and natural-looking. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `alpha_matting_foreground_threshold`: Threshold value for determining foreground pixels when alpha matting is applied, influencing the segmentation's precision. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha_matting_background_threshold`: Threshold value for identifying background pixels in the context of alpha matting, affecting the segmentation's accuracy. Type should be `INT`.
        - `alpha_matting_erode_size`: Size of the erosion applied to the mask during alpha matting, which can refine the segmentation edges. Type should be `INT`.
        - `post_process_mask`: Indicates whether the segmented mask should undergo post-processing to enhance quality. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The images to be segmented. This parameter is crucial as it directly influences the segmentation outcome. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The segmented images, where the foreground is separated from the background, ready for further processing or visualization. Type should be `IMAGE`.
