- `ADE_PairedConditioningSetMask`: The ADE_PairedConditioningSetMask node is designed to apply masking and conditioning adjustments to a pair of conditioning inputs. It utilizes additional parameters such as strength, set condition area, and optional elements like masks, Lora hooks, and timestep conditions to fine-tune the conditioning process, aiming to enhance or modify the generated content's attributes according to the specified adjustments.
    - Parameters:
        - `strength`: Determines the intensity of the conditioning adjustment. A higher value indicates a stronger effect on the conditioning inputs. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `set_cond_area`: Defines the area of the conditioning inputs to be affected by the adjustments. It allows for targeted modifications within the conditioning inputs. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `positive_ADD`: Specifies the positive conditioning input to be adjusted. It plays a crucial role in defining the attributes or features to be enhanced or modified in the generated content. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative_ADD`: Specifies the negative conditioning input to be adjusted. It is essential for defining the attributes or features to be diminished or altered in the opposite manner to the positive conditioning. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `opt_mask`: An optional mask that can be applied to the conditioning inputs for more precise adjustments. Type should be `MASK`.
        - `opt_lora_hook`: An optional Lora hook that can be applied for additional conditioning transformations. Type should be `LORA_HOOK`.
        - `opt_timesteps`: Optional timesteps condition that allows for temporal adjustments to the conditioning inputs. Type should be `TIMESTEPS_COND`.
    - Outputs:
        - `positive`: The adjusted positive conditioning output after applying the specified adjustments. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: The adjusted negative conditioning output after applying the specified adjustments. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
