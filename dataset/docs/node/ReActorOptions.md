- `ReActorOptions`: The ReActorOptions node provides a mechanism for configuring various options related to face swapping operations within the ReActor framework. It allows for the customization of face detection, gender detection, and logging levels to tailor the face swapping process to specific needs.
    - Parameters:
        - `input_faces_order`: Specifies the order in which input faces are processed, offering several strategies such as left-right, top-bottom, or based on size. This affects the selection and prioritization of faces for operations. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `input_faces_index`: Determines the index of the face to be processed in the input image, enabling targeted operations on specific faces. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `detect_gender_input`: Enables gender detection for the input faces, allowing for gender-specific processing or filtering. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `source_faces_order`: Defines the order for processing source faces, similar to input_faces_order, but applied to the source images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `source_faces_index`: Specifies the index of the face in the source image to be used, facilitating precise control over the source face selection. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `detect_gender_source`: Activates gender detection for source faces, which can be used to apply gender-specific adjustments or selections. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `console_log_level`: Sets the verbosity level of console logging, allowing users to control the amount of log output generated during operations. Type should be `COMBO[INT]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `options`: Outputs the configured options for face swapping operations, encapsulating settings like face and gender detection preferences. Type should be `OPTIONS`.
