- `LayerUtility_ TextImage`: This node is designed to generate images from text by applying specific font styles, sizes, and colors. It allows for the customization of text appearance on images, including the layout and spacing, to create visually appealing graphics or text overlays on images. The node leverages image processing techniques to convert text into a graphical representation, suitable for a variety of applications such as dynamic image generation, graphic design, and content creation.
    - Inputs:
        - `text` (Required): The text to be converted into an image. This parameter is crucial as it defines the content that will be visually represented in the generated image. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `font_file` (Required): Specifies the font file to use for the text rendering. This affects the style and appearance of the text in the image, allowing for a wide range of typographic designs. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `spacing` (Required): Controls the spacing between characters in the text. Adjusting this parameter can enhance readability or achieve a desired stylistic effect. Type should be `INT`.
        - `leading` (Required): Determines the leading (line spacing) of the text, which is the distance between the baselines of successive lines of type. This parameter helps in adjusting the layout of text blocks for better visual composition. Type should be `INT`.
        - `horizontal_border` (Required): The horizontal border padding for the text within the image. This parameter ensures that the text does not touch the edges of the image, providing a cleaner look. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `vertical_border` (Required): The vertical border padding for the text within the image. Similar to the horizontal border, it prevents the text from touching the top and bottom edges of the image. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `scale` (Required): Affects the overall size of the text in the image. Scaling the text up or down can help it fit better within the image or achieve a specific visual impact. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `variation_range` (Required): Defines the range of variation for random adjustments to the text appearance, such as size or position, to add uniqueness or dynamism to the generated image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `variation_seed` (Required): The seed for generating random variations in text appearance, ensuring reproducibility of the text styling when needed. Type should be `INT`.
        - `layout` (Required): Specifies the layout orientation of the text within the image, such as horizontal or vertical alignment, influencing the overall composition and readability. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `width` (Required): The width of the image canvas on which the text is rendered. This parameter defines the horizontal boundary for the text layout and appearance. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height` (Required): The height of the image canvas on which the text is rendered. This parameter defines the vertical boundary for the text layout and appearance. Type should be `INT`.
        - `text_color` (Required): The color of the text. This parameter allows for customization of the text's visual impact against the image background. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `background_color` (Required): The background color of the image. It sets the overall tone of the image and can affect the contrast and visibility of the text. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `size_as` (Optional): An optional parameter that allows the image size to be defined relative to another element or parameter, providing flexibility in image scaling and layout. Type should be `*`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The generated image with the text rendered according to the specified parameters. This output is the primary result of the node's processing, showcasing the text as a visual element within an image. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: A mask that represents the area of the text within the generated image. This can be useful for further image processing tasks, such as compositing or applying effects specifically to the text area. Type should be `MASK`.
