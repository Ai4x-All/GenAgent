- `VHS_SplitLatents`: The VHS_SplitLatents node is designed to divide a batch of latents into two groups based on a specified index. This functionality is essential for managing and manipulating latent batches within video processing workflows, allowing for flexible dataset segmentation and targeted processing of latent representations.
    - Inputs:
        - `latents` (Required): The 'latents' parameter represents the batch of latent vectors to be split. It is crucial for determining the composition of the resulting groups post-split, affecting the node's execution and outcomes. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `split_index` (Required): The 'split_index' parameter specifies the position at which the batch of latents should be divided. It plays a pivotal role in determining the size and content of the two resulting latent groups, impacting the node's functionality. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `LATENT_A`: Represents the first group of latent vectors obtained after the split, based on the provided split index. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `A_count`: Indicates the count of latent vectors in the first group post-split. Type should be `INT`.
        - `LATENT_B`: Denotes the second group of latent vectors obtained after the split, following the provided split index. Type should be `LATENT`.
        - `B_count`: Specifies the count of latent vectors in the second group post-split. Type should be `INT`.
