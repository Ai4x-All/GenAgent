- `PixelTiledKSampleUpscalerProviderPipe`: This node is designed to upscale images using a tiled K-sample upscaling method. It leverages a specific upscaling model and various configuration options to enhance image resolution in a tiled manner, allowing for efficient handling of larger images by processing them in smaller, manageable sections.
    - Parameters:
        - `scale_method`: Specifies the method used for scaling the image, affecting the upscaling process's overall approach and quality. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `seed`: Determines the random seed used during the upscaling process, ensuring reproducibility of results. Type should be `INT`.
        - `steps`: Defines the number of steps to perform during the upscaling, impacting the detail and quality of the upscaled image. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Configuration setting that influences the sampling behavior during upscaling. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Identifies the sampler to use, affecting the texture and details of the upscaled image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Specifies the scheduler for controlling the upscaling process, including step size and other parameters. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: Indicates whether denoising is applied during the upscaling process, improving image clarity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `tile_width`: The width of the tiles used in the upscaling process, determining how the image is divided. Type should be `INT`.
        - `tile_height`: The height of the tiles used in the upscaling process, determining how the image is divided. Type should be `INT`.
        - `tiling_strategy`: The strategy used for tiling the image during upscaling, affecting how image sections are processed. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `basic_pipe`: A pipeline of models and configurations used as the basis for the upscaling process. Type should be `BASIC_PIPE`.
        - `upscale_model_opt`: Optional configurations for the upscaling model, allowing for customization of the upscaling behavior. Type should be `UPSCALE_MODEL`.
        - `pk_hook_opt`: Optional hook for post-processing, enabling additional image adjustments after upscaling. Type should be `PK_HOOK`.
        - `tile_cnet_opt`: Optional configuration for tile conditioning, influencing how individual tiles are processed during upscaling. Type should be `CONTROL_NET`.
    - Outputs:
        - `upscaler`: The result of the upscaling process, providing an enhanced version of the input image. Type should be `UPSCALER`.
