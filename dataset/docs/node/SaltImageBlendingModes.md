- `SaltImageBlendingModes`: This node is designed for blending two sets of images together using a variety of blending modes. It allows for the adjustment of blend percentages and the application of masks to control the blending process, offering a flexible approach to creating composite images.
    - Parameters:
        - `mode`: Specifies the blending mode to be used. Each mode applies a different algorithm for combining the images, affecting the visual outcome of the blend. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `blend_percentage`: Determines the intensity of the blend between the two image sets. A higher percentage results in a stronger presence of the overlay images. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images_a`: The first set of images to be blended. These serve as the base layer in the blending process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `images_b`: The second set of images to be blended with the first set. These images act as the overlay layer. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `masks`: Optional masks that can be applied to the images to control where the blending occurs. Useful for creating more precise or complex composite images. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `images`: The resulting set of blended images. Type should be `IMAGE`.
