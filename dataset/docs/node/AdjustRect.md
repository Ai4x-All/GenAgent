- `AdjustRect`: The AdjustRect node is designed to adjust the dimensions and position of a rectangle based on specified modifiers and rounding modes. It abstracts the complexity of geometric transformations, offering a streamlined way to recalibrate rectangle coordinates for various applications.
    - Parameters:
        - `a`: Represents one of the coordinates (either x1 or y1) of the original rectangle, playing a crucial role in determining the new adjusted rectangle's position. Type should be `INT`.
        - `b`: Represents one of the coordinates (either x2 or y2) of the original rectangle, contributing to the calculation of the new rectangle's dimensions and position. Type should be `INT`.
        - `c`: Serves as a modifier to adjust the rectangle's width, directly influencing the final dimensions of the adjusted rectangle. Type should be `INT`.
        - `d`: Serves as a modifier to adjust the rectangle's height, directly influencing the final dimensions of the adjusted rectangle. Type should be `INT`.
        - `xm`: Specifies the modifier for the rectangle's width adjustment, affecting the calculation of the new width. Type should be `INT`.
        - `ym`: Specifies the modifier for the rectangle's height adjustment, affecting the calculation of the new height. Type should be `INT`.
        - `round_mode`: Determines the rounding mode to be applied during the adjustment process, impacting how the final dimensions are calculated. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `input_format`: Defines the format of the input coordinates, influencing how they are interpreted and transformed during the adjustment. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `output_format`: Specifies the format for the output coordinates, determining how the adjusted rectangle's dimensions and position are represented. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `int`: The adjusted rectangle's coordinates, reflecting the modifications applied based on the input parameters. It is represented as a tuple of four integers. Type should be `INT`.
