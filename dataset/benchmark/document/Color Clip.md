- `Color Clip`: The Color Clip node is designed to modify the colors within an image based on specific target and complement operations, optionally allowing for advanced color manipulation through additional color parameters. It leverages color theory principles to enhance or alter the visual appearance of images, making it a versatile tool for image processing tasks that require color adjustments.
    - Inputs:
        - `image` (Required): The image to be processed. It serves as the primary input for color clipping operations, determining the visual content that will undergo color modifications. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `target` (Required): Specifies the target operation for color clipping, influencing how colors in the image are adjusted or replaced. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `complement` (Required): Defines the complement operation for color clipping, determining the alternative color adjustments or replacements in the image. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `color` (Required): The reference color used for clipping operations. It plays a crucial role in defining the color adjustments to be applied to the image. Type should be `COLOR`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The processed image with applied color clipping operations, showcasing the adjustments or alterations made to the original colors. Type should be `IMAGE`.
