- `DownloadAndLoadCCSRModel`: This node is responsible for downloading and loading the CCSR model into memory, ensuring it is ready for use. It handles the model's retrieval, configuration, and initialization, adapting to the required precision (FP16 or FP32) based on the model's specifications.
    - Inputs:
        - `model` (Required): Specifies the model variant to be loaded, influencing the precision (FP16 or FP32) and the specific model configuration to be used. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Outputs:
        - `ccsr_model`: Provides the loaded CCSR model along with its data type, ready for further processing or inference. Type should be `CCSRMODEL`.
