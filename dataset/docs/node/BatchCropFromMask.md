- `BatchCropFromMask`: The BatchCropFromMask node is designed to process a batch of masks and corresponding images, identifying and cropping out the relevant areas defined by the masks. It dynamically calculates the optimal bounding box for each mask to ensure that the cropped images retain the most significant parts of the original images, based on the presence of non-zero pixels in the masks.
    - Parameters:
        - `crop_size_mult`: The 'crop_size_mult' parameter allows for adjusting the size of the crop dynamically. It acts as a multiplier to the calculated bounding box dimensions, enabling fine-tuning of the crop size based on specific requirements. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `bbox_smooth_alpha`: The 'bbox_smooth_alpha' parameter is used to smooth the changes in bounding box sizes across different masks. This helps in achieving more consistent crop sizes and shapes by applying a smoothing factor to the size calculations. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `original_images`: The 'original_images' parameter is a batch of images that correspond to the masks provided. These images are cropped according to the calculated bounding boxes from the masks, resulting in a set of images focused on the areas of interest. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `masks`: The 'masks' parameter represents a batch of masks that define areas of interest within the corresponding images. It is crucial for determining the regions to crop, as the node calculates bounding boxes based on these masks. Type should be `MASK`.
    - Outputs:
        - `original_images`: This output includes the original images provided as input, unchanged by the cropping process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `cropped_images`: This output includes the images cropped according to the calculated bounding boxes from the masks, focusing on the areas of interest. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `bboxes`: This output provides the bounding boxes calculated for each mask, indicating the areas that were cropped from the original images. Type should be `BBOX`.
        - `width`: This output provides the width of the largest bounding box calculated across all masks, after adjustments and smoothing. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: This output provides the height of the largest bounding box calculated across all masks, after adjustments and smoothing. Type should be `INT`.
