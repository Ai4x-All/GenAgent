- `ImageEffectsLensZoomBurst`: This node applies a zoom burst effect to images, dynamically altering their appearance by scaling, rotating, and optionally stabilizing them to create a motion-like illusion. It's designed to enhance visual content by simulating a rapid zoom effect, often used to add drama or focus to specific areas of an image.
    - Parameters:
        - `scale`: Defines the scaling factor for the zoom burst effect, determining how much the images will be zoomed in or out during the effect application. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `samples`: Specifies the number of samples to use in creating the zoom burst effect, affecting the smoothness and intensity of the final output. Type should be `INT`.
        - `position_x`: The x-coordinate of the position within the images where the zoom burst effect will be centered, allowing for targeted visual emphasis on specific image areas. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `position_y`: The y-coordinate of the position within the images where the zoom burst effect will be centered, allowing for targeted visual emphasis on specific image areas. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `rotation`: Determines the rotation angle applied to the images in conjunction with the zoom effect, adding a dynamic twist to the visual outcome. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `method`: The method used to apply the zoom burst effect, potentially influencing the effect's appearance and performance. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `stabilization`: Indicates whether stabilization techniques are applied to reduce potential blurring or disorientation effects, enhancing the visual clarity of the zoom burst. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The input images to apply the zoom burst effect on. They are the primary subjects of the transformation, where the effect's parameters will be applied to create the desired visual outcome. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output image after applying the zoom burst effect, showcasing the transformed visual appearance with the intended dynamic, motion-like illusion. Type should be `IMAGE`.
