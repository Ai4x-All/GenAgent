- `Repeat Into Grid (image)`: This node tiles the input image samples into a grid of configurable dimensions, effectively repeating the image across a specified number of rows and columns to create a larger, grid-like composite image.
    - Parameters:
        - `columns`: Specifies the number of columns in the grid. It determines how many times the input image is repeated horizontally. Type should be `INT`.
        - `rows`: Specifies the number of rows in the grid. It determines how many times the input image is repeated vertically. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `image`: The input image to be tiled across the grid. It determines the base image that will be repeated across the specified grid dimensions. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is a single image composed of the input image tiled according to the specified rows and columns, forming a grid. Type should be `IMAGE`.
