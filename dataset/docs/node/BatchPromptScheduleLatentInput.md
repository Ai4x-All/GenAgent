- `BatchPromptScheduleLatentInput`: This node is designed to process animation prompts for batch scheduling with latent inputs. It sequences the user's formatted prompt into current and next prompts along with conditioning strength, evaluates expressions within these prompts, and applies a scheduling algorithm to generate a batch of conditionings tailored to the input latent values. The node's functionality emphasizes the dynamic adaptation of text-based animation prompts to the temporal dimension of animations, facilitating the creation of nuanced and temporally coherent animated sequences.
    - Parameters:
        - `text`: This parameter represents the primary text prompt for the animation, serving as the foundational content from which positive and negative prompts are derived. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `print_output`: A boolean parameter that controls whether the output of the animation process is printed, aiding in debugging and process visualization. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `pre_text`: Pre-text is added before the main text prompt to modify or guide the animation's thematic direction. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `app_text`: Appended text that follows the main text prompt, further tailoring the animation's narrative or aesthetic. Type should be `STRING`.
        - `start_frame`: Specifies the starting frame for the animation, setting the initial point for prompt scheduling and animation generation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `end_frame`: The ending frame number for the animation, determining the terminal point of the sequence. Type should be `INT`.
        - `pw_a`: A floating-point parameter that influences the weighting of animation prompts, contributing to the scheduling algorithm's complexity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_b`: Similar to pw_a, this floating-point parameter further adjusts the prompt weighting, allowing for nuanced control over the animation's development. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_c`: This parameter works alongside pw_a and pw_b to refine the weighting and scheduling of animation prompts, enhancing the final output's dynamic range. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `pw_d`: Completes the set of weight parameters (pw_a, pw_b, pw_c), pw_d offers additional fine-tuning of the prompt scheduling process for the animation. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `clip`: This parameter is essential for the animation process, providing the clip information required for generating the animation. Type should be `CLIP`.
        - `num_latents`: Represents the number of latent inputs that influence the animation generation process, providing a basis for dynamic adaptation. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `POS`: This output represents the positive conditioning generated for the animation, based on the scheduled prompts. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `NEG`: This output denotes the negative conditioning generated for the animation, contrasting with the positive to add depth and complexity. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `INPUT_LATENTS`: This output returns the input latents, potentially modified or directly passed through the scheduling process. Type should be `LATENT`.
