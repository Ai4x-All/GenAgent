- `easy imageRemBg`: This node is designed to remove the background from images, offering a straightforward way for users to process images by isolating the foreground from the background. It supports different removal modes to accommodate various use cases and image types.
    - Parameters:
        - `image_output`: Determines how the output images are handled, such as whether they are saved, hidden, or displayed. This parameter influences the node's output behavior, affecting the visibility and storage of the processed images. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `save_prefix`: A prefix added to the filenames of saved images, providing a way to organize and identify processed images easily. Type should be `STRING`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The images from which the background should be removed. This input is crucial for determining the subject matter and executing the background removal process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `rem_mode`: Specifies the mode of background removal to be used, such as 'RMBG-1.4'. This affects the algorithm and technique applied for background removal, tailoring the process to the specific needs of the input images. Type should be `['RMBG-1.4']`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The resulting image after background removal, with the foreground preserved and the background made transparent or removed. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `mask`: The mask generated during the background removal process, indicating areas of the image that were identified as foreground. Type should be `MASK`.
