- `ChameleonMask`: The ChameleonMask node is designed to dynamically adapt or modify image masks based on certain criteria or inputs, allowing for flexible and context-sensitive mask manipulation.
    - Parameters:
        - `thresh_blur`: Defines the threshold for blurring the mask, affecting the mask's edge smoothness. Type should be `INT`.
        - `close_dist`: Specifies the distance for the closing operation on the mask, influencing the mask's compactness. Type should be `INT`.
        - `open_dist`: Determines the distance for the opening operation, affecting the mask's granularity. Type should be `INT`.
        - `size_dist`: Controls the size distribution adjustment for the mask, impacting the overall mask structure. Type should be `INT`.
        - `mask_blur`: Sets the level of blurring applied to the mask, modifying its softness and transparency. Type should be `INT`.
        - `contrast_adjust`: Adjusts the contrast of the mask, enhancing or reducing the mask's visual intensity. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `mode`: Specifies the mode of operation for mask generation, offering different strategies for mask creation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `output_format`: Determines the format of the output image, affecting the visual representation of the mask. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
    - Inputs:
        - `dst`: The destination image where the mask will be applied, serving as the canvas for the final output. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `src`: The source image from which the mask is generated, acting as the primary input for mask creation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `optional_roi_mask`: An optional region of interest mask that can be applied to further refine the mask generation process. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is an image with the mask applied, showcasing the result of the mask manipulation. Type should be `IMAGE`.
