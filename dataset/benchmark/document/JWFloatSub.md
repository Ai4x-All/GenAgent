- `JWFloatSub`: The node is designed to perform subtraction between two floating-point numbers, providing a straightforward way to calculate the difference between values in a computational graph.
    - Inputs:
        - `a` (Required): Represents the minuend in the subtraction operation, essentially the number from which another number (the subtrahend) is to be subtracted. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `b` (Required): Represents the subtrahend in the subtraction operation, essentially the number that is to be subtracted from another number (the minuend). Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `float`: The result of the subtraction operation between two floating-point numbers. Type should be `FLOAT`.
