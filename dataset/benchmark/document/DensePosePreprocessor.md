- `DensePosePreprocessor`: The DensePosePreprocessor node is designed to estimate dense human body poses from images. It preprocesses images using a selected DensePose model and color map to generate detailed body pose estimations.
    - Inputs:
        - `image` (Required): The input image to be processed for dense pose estimation. This image is the primary input on which the pose estimation is performed. Type should be `IMAGE`.
        - `model` (Optional): Specifies the DensePose model to be used for pose estimation. The choice of model can affect the accuracy and performance of the pose estimation. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `cmap` (Optional): Determines the color map used for visualizing the pose estimation results. Different color maps can provide varying visual clarity and aesthetic appeal. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `resolution` (Optional): The resolution to which the input image is resized before processing. A higher resolution can lead to more detailed pose estimations but may increase processing time. Type should be `INT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: Produces an image with the dense pose estimation visualized according to the selected color map. Type should be `IMAGE`.
