- `Tensor Batch to Image`: This node is designed to convert a batch of tensor images into a single tensor image based on a specified index. It facilitates the selection of a specific image from a batch for further processing or visualization.
    - Parameters:
        - `batch_image_number`: The index of the image within the batch to be converted into a tensor image. This parameter determines which image from the batch is selected for output. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images_batch`: A batch of images represented as tensors. This input is crucial for selecting a specific image from the batch for conversion. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The output is a single tensor image selected from the input batch based on the specified index. Type should be `IMAGE`.
