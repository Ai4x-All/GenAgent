- `ImageEffectsAdjustment`: This node applies a series of image adjustments including brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, gamma, and sharpness, along with RGB color scaling, to a batch of images. It allows for fine-tuning of visual aspects of images to achieve desired effects or corrections.
    - Parameters:
        - `brightness`: Adjusts the brightness level of the images. A value greater than 1.0 increases brightness, while a value less than 1.0 decreases it. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `contrast`: Modifies the contrast of the images. Values greater than 1.0 enhance contrast, whereas values less than 1.0 reduce it. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `saturation`: Alters the saturation level of the images, enhancing or diminishing the intensity of colors. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `hue`: Changes the hue of the images, allowing for shifts in color spectrum. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `gamma`: Applies gamma correction to the images, adjusting the luminance. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sharpness`: Adjusts the sharpness of the images, making them appear clearer or softer. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `red`: Scales the red channel of the images, affecting the intensity of red hues. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `green`: Scales the green channel of the images, affecting the intensity of green hues. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `blue`: Scales the blue channel of the images, affecting the intensity of blue hues. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `images`: The batch of images to be adjusted. Each adjustment is applied to all images in the batch, allowing for consistent image processing across multiple inputs. Type should be `IMAGE`.
    - Outputs:
        - `image`: The batch of images after applying the specified adjustments, potentially including changes in brightness, contrast, saturation, hue, gamma, sharpness, and RGB color scaling. Type should be `IMAGE`.
