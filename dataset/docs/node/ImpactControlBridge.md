- `ImpactControlBridge`: The ImpactControlBridge node serves as a dynamic control mechanism for managing the state of other nodes within a ComfyUI environment. It enables the activation, muting, or bypassing of specified nodes based on operational modes, thereby facilitating flexible workflow adjustments and error handling through the use of signals.
    - Parameters:
        - `mode`: Determines the operational mode of the node, such as active, mute, or bypass, affecting how other nodes are controlled. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
        - `behavior`: Specifies the behavior of the node in terms of muting or bypassing, providing additional control over the workflow. Type should be `BOOLEAN`.
    - Inputs:
        - `value`: Represents the value to be processed, which can influence the control bridge's decision-making process. Type should be `*`.
    - Outputs:
        - `value`: The processed value, reflecting the outcome of the control bridge's operations. Type should be `*`.
